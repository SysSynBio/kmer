abstract = {We study the phylogeny of the placental mammals using molecular data
from all mitochondrial tRNAs and rRNAs of 54 species. We use probabilistic
substitution models specific to evolution in base paired regions
of RNA. A number of these models have been implemented in a new phylogenetic
inference software package for carrying out maximum likelihood and
Bayesian phylogenetic inferences. We describe our Bayesian phylogenetic
method which uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to provide
samples from the posterior distribution of tree topologies. Our results
show support for four primary mammalian clades, in agreement with
recent studies of much larger data sets mainly comprising nuclear
DNA. We discuss some issues arising when using Bayesian techniques
on RNA sequence data.},

abstract = {An increasing number of phylogenetic analyses are based on the internal
transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2). They mainly use the fast evolving sequence
for low-level analyses. When considering the highly conserved structure,
the same marker could also be used for higher level phylogenies.
Furthermore, structural features of the ITS2 allow distinguishing
different species from each other. Despite its importance, the correct
structure is only rarely found by standard RNA folding algorithms.
To overcome this hindrance for a wider application of the ITS2, we
have developed a homology modelling approach to predict the structure
of RNA and present the results of modelling the ITS2 in the ITS2
Database. Here, we describe the database and the underlying algorithms
which allowed us to predict the structure for 86 784 sequences, which
is more than 55{\%} of all GenBank entries concerning the ITS2. These
are not equally distributed over all genera. There is a substantial
amount of genera where the structure of nearly all sequences is predicted
whereas for others no structure at all was found despite high sequence
coverage. These genera might have evolved an ITS2 structure diverging
from the standard one. The current version of the ITS2 Database can

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The discovery of functional non-coding RNA sequences has
led to an increasing interest in algorithms related to RNA analysis.
Traditional sequence alignment algorithms, however, fail at computing
reliable alignments of low-homology RNA sequences. The spatial conformation
of RNA sequences largely determines their function, and therefore
RNA alignment algorithms have to take structural information into
account. RESULTS: We present a graph-based representation for sequence-structure
alignments, which we model as an integer linear program (ILP). We
sketch how we compute an optimal or near-optimal solution to the
ILP using methods from combinatorial optimization, and present results
on a recently published benchmark set for RNA alignments. CONCLUSION:
The implementation of our algorithm yields better alignments in terms
of two published scores than the other programs that we tested: This
is especially the case with an increasing number of input sequences.

abstract = {The estimation of amino acid replacement frequencies during molecular
evolution is crucial for many applications in sequence analysis.
Score matrices for database search programs or phylogenetic analysis
rely on such models of protein evolution. Pioneering work was done
by Dayhoff et al. (1978) who formulated a Markov model of evolution
and derived the famous PAM score matrices. Her estimation procedure
for amino acid exchange frequencies is restricted to pairs of proteins
that have a constant and small degree of divergence. Here we present
an improved estimator, called the resolvent method, that is not subject
to these limitations. This extension of Dayhoff's approach enables
us to estimate an amino acid substitution model from alignments of
varying degree of divergence. Extensive simulations show the capability
of the new estimator to recover accurately the exchange frequencies
among amino acids. Based on the SYSTERS database of aligned protein
families (Krause and Vingron, 1998) we recompute a series of score

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In sequence analysis the multiple alignment builds the
fundament of all proceeding analyses. Errors in an alignment could
strongly influence all succeeding analyses and therefore could lead
to wrong predictions. Hand-crafted and hand-improved alignments are
necessary and meanwhile good common practice. For RNA sequences often
the primary sequence as well as a secondary structure consensus is
well known, e.g., the cloverleaf structure of the t-RNA. Recently,
some alignment editors are proposed that are able to include and
model both kinds of information. However, with the advent of a large
amount of reliable RNA sequences together with their solved secondary
structures (available from e.g. the ITS2 Database), we are faced
with the problem to handle sequences and their associated secondary
structures synchronously. RESULTS: 4SALE fills this gap. The application
allows a fast sequence and synchronous secondary structure alignment
for large data sets and for the first time synchronous manual editing
of aligned sequences and their secondary structures. This study describes
an algorithm for the synchronous alignment of sequences and their
associated secondary structures as well as the main features of 4SALE
used for further analyses and editing. 4SALE builds an optimal and
unique starting point for every RNA sequence and structure analysis.
CONCLUSION: 4SALE, which provides an user-friendly and intuitive
interface, is a comprehensive toolbox for RNA analysis based on sequence
and secondary structure information. The program connects sequence
and structure databases like the ITS2 Database to phylogeny programs
as for example the CBCAnalyzer. 4SALE is written in JAVA and therefore
platform independent. The software is freely available and distributed

@article{Gascuel1997,
abstract = {We propose an improved version of the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm
of Saitou and Nei. This new algorithm, BIONJ, follows the same agglomerative
scheme as NJ, which consists of iteratively picking a pair of taxa,
creating a new mode which represents the cluster of these taxa, and
reducing the distance matrix by replacing both taxa by this node.
Moreover, BIONJ uses a simple first-order model of the variances
and covariances of evolutionary distance estimates. This model is
well adapted when these estimates are obtained from aligned sequences.
At each step it permits the selection, from the class of admissible
reductions, of the reduction which minimizes the variance of the
new distance matrix. In this way, we obtain better estimates to choose
the pair of taxa to be agglomerated during the next steps. Moreover,
in comparison with NJ's estimates, these estimates become better
and better as the algorithm proceeds. BIONJ retains the good properties
of NJ--especially its low run time. Computer simulations have been
performed with 12-taxon model trees to determine BIONJ's efficiency.
When the substitution rates are low (maximum pairwise divergence
approximately 0.1 substitutions per site) or when they are constant
among lineages, BIONJ is only slightly better than NJ. When the substitution
rates are higher and vary among lineages,BIONJ clearly has better
topological accuracy. In the latter case, for the model trees and
the conditions of evolution tested, the topological error reduction
is on the average around 20{\%}. With highly-varying-rate trees and
with high substitution rates (maximum pairwise divergence approximately
1.0 substitutions per site), the error reduction may even rise above
50{\%}, while the probability of finding the correct tree may be augmented
by as much as 15{\%}.},

abstract = {The ongoing characterization of novel species creates the need for
a molecular marker which can be used for species- and, simultaneously,
for mega-systematics. Recently, the use of the internal transcribed
spacer 2 (ITS2) sequence was suggested, as it shows a high divergence
in sequence with an assumed conservation in structure. This hypothesis
was mainly based on small-scale analyses, comparing a limited number
of sequences. Here, we report a large-scale analysis of more than
54,000 currently known ITS2 sequences with the goal to evaluate the
hypothesis of a conserved structural core and to assess its use for
automated large-scale phylogenetics. Structure prediction revealed
that the previously described core structure can be found for more
than 5000 sequences in a wide variety of taxa within the eukaryotes,
indicating that the core secondary structure is indeed conserved.
This conserved structure allowed an automated alignment of extremely
divergent sequences as exemplified for the ITS2 sequences of a ctenophorean
eumetazoon and a volvocalean green alga. All classified sequences,
together with their structures can be accessed at http://www.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/bioinformatik/projects/ITS2.html.
Furthermore, we found that, although sample sequences are known for
most major taxa, there exists a profound divergence in coverage,
which might become a hindrance for general usage. In summary, our
analysis strengthens the potential of ITS2 as a general phylogenetic
marker and provides a data source for further ITS2-based analyses.},

a number of evolutionary models designed specifically for use with
RNA sequences that have conserved secondary structure. Evolution
in the paired regions of RNAs occurs via compensatory substitutions,

for this correlation is important for phylogenetic inference because
it affects the likelihood calculation. In the present study we use
the complete set of tRNA and rRNA sequences from 69 complete mammalian
mitochondrial genomes. The likelihood calculation uses two evolutionary
models simultaneously for different parts of the sequence: a paired-site
model for the paired sites and a single-site model for the unpaired
sites. We use Bayesian phylogenetic methods and a Markov chain Monte
Carlo algorithm is used to obtain the most probable trees and posterior
probabilities of clades. The results are well resolved for almost
all the important branches on the mammalian tree. They support the
arrangement of mammalian orders within the four supra-ordinal clades
that have been identified by studies of much larger data sets mainly
comprising nuclear genes. Groups such as the hedgehogs and the murid
rodents, which have been problematic in previous studies with mitochondrial
proteins, appear in their expected position with the other members

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most phylogenetic studies using current methods have focused
on primary DNA sequence information. However, RNA secondary structures
are particularly useful in systematics because they include characteristics,
not found in the primary sequence, that give "morphological" information.
Despite the number of recent molecular studies on octocorals, there
is no consensus opinion about a region that carries enough phylogenetic
resolution to solve intrageneric or close species relationships.
Moreover, intrageneric morphological information by itself does not
always produce accurate phylogenies; intra-species comparisons can
reveal greater differences than intra-generic ones. The search for
new phylogenetic approaches, such as by RNA secondary structure analysis,
is therefore a priority in octocoral research. RESULTS: Initially,
twelve predicted RNA secondary structures were reconstructed to provide
the basic information for phylogenetic analyses; they accorded with
the 6 helicoidal ring model, also present in other groups of corals
and eukaryotes. We obtained three similar topologies for nine species
of the Caribbean gorgonian genus Eunicea (candelabrum corals) with
two sister taxa as outgroups (genera Plexaura and Pseudoplexaura)
on the basis of molecular morphometrics of ITS2 RNA secondary structures
only, traditional primary sequence analyses and maximum likelihood,
and a Bayesian analysis of the combined data. The latter approach
allowed us to include both primary sequence and RNA molecular morphometrics;
each data partition was allowed to have a different evolution rate.
In addition, each helix was partitioned as if it had evolved at a
distinct rate. Plexaura flexuosa was found to group within Eunicea;
this was best supported by both the molecular morphometrics and combined
analyses. We suggest Eunicea flexuosa (Lamouroux, 1821) comb. nov.,
and we present a new species description including Scanning Electron
Microscopy (SEM) images of morphological characteristics (sclerites).
Eunicea flexuosa, E. pallida, E. laxispica and E. mammosa formed
a separate clade in the molecular phylogenies, and were reciprocally
monophyletic with respect to other Eunicea (Euniceopsis subgenus,
e.g. E. tourneforti and E. laciniata) in the molecular morphometrics
tree, with the exception of E. fusca. Moreover, we suggest a new
diagnostic character for Eunicea, also present in E. flexuosa: middle
layer sclerites {\textgreater} 1 mm in length. CONCLUSION: ITS2 was a reliable
sequence for intrageneric studies in gorgonian octocorals because
of the amount of phylogenetic signal, and was corroborated against
morphological characters separating Eunicea from Plexaura. The ITS2
RNA secondary structure approach to phylogeny presented here did
not rely on alignment methods such as INDELS, but provided clearly
homologous characters for partition analysis and RNA molecular morphometrics.
These approaches support the divergence of Eunicea flexuosa comb.

@article{Smith2004,
abstract = {Empirical models of substitution are often used in protein sequence
analysis because the large alphabet of amino acids requires that
many parameters be estimated in all but the simplest parametric models.
When information about structure is used in the analysis of substitutions
in structured RNA, a similar situation occurs. The number of parameters
necessary to adequately describe the substitution process increases
in order to model the substitution of paired bases. We have developed
a method to obtain substitution rate matrices empirically from RNA
alignments that include structural information in the form of base
pairs. Our data consisted of alignments from the European Ribosomal
RNA Database of Bacterial and Eukaryotic Small Subunit and Large
Subunit Ribosomal RNA ( Wuyts et al. 2001. Nucleic Acids Res. 29:175-177;
Wuyts et al. 2002. Nucleic Acids Res. 30:183-185). Using secondary
structural information, we converted each sequence in the alignments
into a sequence over a 20-symbol code: one symbol for each of the
four individual bases, and one symbol for each of the 16 ordered
pairs. Substitutions in the coded sequences are defined in the natural
way, as observed changes between two sequences at any particular
site. For given ranges (windows) of sequence divergence, we obtained
substitution frequency matrices for the coded sequences. Using a
technique originally developed for modeling amino acid substitutions
( Veerassamy, Smith, and Tillier. 2003. J. Comput. Biol. 10:997-1010),
we were able to estimate the actual evolutionary distance for each
window. The actual evolutionary distances were used to derive instantaneous
rate matrices, and from these we selected a universal rate matrix.
The universal rate matrices were incorporated into the Phylip Software
package ( Felsenstein 2002. http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html),
and we analyzed the ribosomal RNA alignments using both distance
and maximum likelihood methods. The empirical substitution models
performed well on simulated data, and produced reasonable evolutionary
trees for 16S ribosomal RNA sequences from sequenced Bacterial genomes.
Empirical models have the advantage of being easily implemented,
and the fact that the code consists of 20 symbols makes the models
easily incorporated into existing programs for protein sequence analysis.
In addition, the models are useful for simulating the evolution of
RNA sequence and structure simultaneously.},

in aligning functional RNAs, several pairwise sequence-structure
alignment methods have been developed. They use extended alignment
scores that evaluate secondary structure information in addition

step remain. First, how to combine pairwise sequence-structure alignments
into a multiple alignment and second, how to generate secondary structure
information for sequences whose explicit structural information is
missing. RESULTS: We describe a novel approach for multiple alignment
of RNAs (MARNA) taking into consideration both the primary and the
secondary structures. It is based on pairwise sequence-structure
comparisons of RNAs. From these sequence-structure alignments, libraries
of weighted alignment edges are generated. The weights reflect the
sequential and structural conservation. For sequences whose secondary
structures are missing, the libraries are generated by sampling low
energy conformations. The libraries are then processed by the T-Coffee
system, which is a consistency based multiple alignment method. Furthermore,
we are able to extract a consensus-sequence and -structure from a

of this method is to find pairs of operational taxonomic units (OTUs

as well as the topology of a parsimonious tree can quickly be obtained
by using this method. Using computer simulation, we studied the efficiency
of this method in obtaining the correct unrooted tree in comparison
with that of five other tree-making methods: the unweighted pair
group method of analysis, Farris's method, Sattath and Tversky's

which has been of broad use in generic and infrageneric level classifications,
as its sequence evolves comparably fast. Only recently, it became
clear, that the ITS2 might be useful even for higher level systematic
analyses. As the secondary structure is highly conserved within all
eukaryotes it serves as a valuable template for the construction
of highly reliable sequence-structure alignments, which build a fundament
for subsequent analyses. Thus, any phylogenetic study using ITS2
has to consider both sequence and structure. We have integrated a
homology based RNA structure prediction algorithm into a web server,
which allows the detection and secondary structure prediction for
ITS2 in any given sequence. Furthermore, the resource contains more
than 25,000 pre-calculated secondary structures for the currently
known ITS2 sequences. These can be taxonomically searched and browsed.
Thus, our resource could become a starting point for ITS2-based phylogenetic
analyses and is therefore complementary to databases of other phylogenetic
markers, which focus on higher level analyses. The current version

abstract = {Coral reefs are the most diverse of all marine ecosystems (1), with estimates of reef species ranging from 600,000 to more than 9 million species worldwide (2, 3). This biodiversity is most pronounced in the western Pacific and Indian Oceans (1, 4), but decreases with increasing distance from the Indo-Australian archipelago. For example, reefs in the central Indo-Pacific have more than 10 times as many coral and fish species as reefs of the Galapagos Islands in the eastern Pacific (4) (see the figure). This striking gradient of biodiversity deserves an explanation (1, 4, 5). On page 1532 of this issue, Bellwood and Hughes (6) present their attempt to explain this biodiversity gradient by analyzing the numbers of coral and fish species associated with 113 reef communities stretching from the Red Sea to the Gulf of California. They discovered that the area of suitable reef habitat surrounding the study sites was by far the best predictor of biodiversity at these sites. Ecologists have long realized that the biodiversity of coral reef species declines dramatically with increasing distance from the epicenter of diversity in the Indo-Australian Pacific. In her Perspective, Knowlton discusses a new analysis by Bellwood and Hughes that reveals the importance of habitat area in maintaining diversity, a finding that underscores the need for reef conservation.},

abstract = {Dinoflagellate genomes present unique challenges including large size, modified DNA bases, lack of nucleosomes, and condensed chromosomes. EST sequencing has shown that many genes are found as many slightly different variants implying that many copies are present in the genome. As a preliminary survey of the genome our goal was to obtain genomic sequences for 47 genes from the dinoflagellate Amphidinium carterae. A PCR approach was used to avoid problems with large insert libraries. One primer set was oriented inward to amplify the genomic complement of the cDNA and a second primer set would amplify outward between tandem repeats of the same gene. Each gene was also tested for a spliced leader using cDNA as template. Almost all (14/15) of the highly expressed genes (i.e. those with high representation in the cDNA pool) were shown to be in tandem arrays with short intergenic spacers, and most were trans-spliced. Only two moderately expressed genes were found in tandem arrays. A polyadenylation signal was found in genomic copies containing the sequence AAAAG/C at the exact polyadenylation site and was conserved between species. Four genes were found to have a high intron density ({\textgreater}5 introns) while most either lacked introns, or had only one to three. Actin was selected for deeper sequencing of both genomic and cDNA copies. Two clusters of actin copies were found, separated from each other by many non-coding features such as intron size and sequence. One intron-rich gene was selected for genomic walking using inverse PCR, and was not shown to be in a tandem repeat. The first glimpse of dinoflagellate genome indicates two general categories of genes in dinoflagellates, a highly expressed tandem repeat class and an intron rich less expressed class. This combination of features appears to be unique among eukaryotes.},

abstract = {Several studies have demonstrated that the temperature tolerance of scleractinian reef-building corals is controlled, in part, by hosting physiologically distinct symbiotic algae. We investigated the thermal tolerance of coral–algal associations within seven common species of reef-building corals hosting distinct Symbiodinium sub-clades collected from Heron Island during experimentally induced bleaching conditions. During experimental heat-ing, photosynthetic fitness was assessed by the dark-adap-ted yield of PSII (F v /F m), and excitation pressure across PSII (Q m) of each coral–algal association using pulse amplitude modulation fluorometry. The onset of bleaching was determined by the measurement of Symbiodinium cell density. Using the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS-2) region, we showed that Symbiodinium type–coral host associations were temporally and spatially conserved in a high proportion of the colonies sampled within each species. Generally, the species Acropora millepora, Platygyra daedalea, Acropora aspera and Acropora for-mosa contained Symbiodinium ITS-2 type C3, whereas the species Montipora digitata, Porites cylindrica and Porites lutea contained Symbiodinium type C15. Bleaching susceptibility showed some association with Symbiodinium type, but further research is required to confirm this. Corals hosting C3 Symbiodinium displayed higher reductions in F v /F m during heating compared to their C15 counterparts, irrespective of host species. However, a corresponding reduction in Symbiodinium density was not observed. Nonetheless, A. aspera and A. formosa showed significant reductions in Symbiodinium density relative to controls. This correlated with large increases in Q m and decreases in F v /F m in heated explants. Our results suggest a range of bleaching susceptibilities for the coral species investigated, with A. aspera and A. formosa showing the greatest sus-ceptibility to bleaching and M. digitata showing the lowest bleaching susceptibility. The data provide strong evidence for distinct differences in temperature tolerance between C3 and C15 Symbiodinium types when in-hospite; how-ever, future studies addressing the confounding effect of host species would help to confirm this.},

Effects of light at optimal temperature were less dramatic. Interactions between physical environmental factors appear to be most important near the limits of tolerance for a given factor.

abstract = {A problem frequently faced by researchers involved in collecting tissues for DNA isolation is the preservation of samples in the field prior to and during their transportation to the laboratory. Prevention of DNA degradation is usually achieved through freezing. As this is not always practical, we have tested the efficiency of chemical solutions containing high concentrations of salts (e.g., NaCl, EDTA, and diaminocyclohexanetetraacetate) and detergent at preserving DNA in bird tissue and blood samples stored at ambient temperature for extended periods of time. For blood samples, we recommend the use of a buffer that lyses the cells and nuclei and contains 0.01 M Tris, 0.01 M NaCl, 0.01 M EDTA, and 1{\%} n-lauroylsarcosine, Ph 7.5. Tissue samples are best preserved as small pieces in a saline solution made of 20{\%} dimethyl sulfoxyde, 0.25 M EDTA, saturated with NaCl, pH 8.0. DNA extracted from samples preserved in these solutions for up to 24 weeks was compared with DNA recovered from tissue samples stored at −70 °C and blood samples stored at −70 and −20 °C. Yields were similar, averaging 300 $\mu$g/0.2 g of tissue and 500 $\mu$g/50 $\mu$L of blood. Quality of DNA in terms of fragment size, ability to be cut by restriction enzymes, and ability to hybridize to radioactive probes was also similar between cryopreserved and chemically preserved samples. Yields of DNA recovered from tissue samples preserved in 70{\%} ethanol for 6 or 11 weeks was very low and significant degradation was observed. We have also examined how DNA contained in crude avian blood samples withstands freeze–thaw cycles. We found normal yields and no significant degradation of DNA in samples that experienced up to six cycles. We encourage field researchers who refrain from preserving tissue samples because of logistical problems, such as transporting liquid nitrogen containers in the field, to consider using these solutions. Both solutions can also facilitate exchanges of samples between laboratories, and they form an alternative to storage of samples at −70 °C for laboratories and museums with limited access to deep-freezing facilities.},

abstract = {We investigated photoacclimation in the symbiotic Mediterranean coral Cladocora caespitosa by exposing it to three light levels (30, 80 and 250 micromol m(-2) s(-1)), which are in the range of those recorded for this species. The coral response to a change in both light and temperature was also assessed, by subjecting coral to two treatments corresponding to winter (14 degrees C and 30 micromol m(-2) s(-1)) and summer (23 degrees C and 250 micromol m(-2) s(-1)) conditions, as measured in the Ligurian Sea. Photosynthesis, measured using both respirometry and pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry, revealed a linear relationship only at low light levels. At higher irradiance, relative electron transport rate (rETR) approached saturation more slowly than rates of oxygen production. At constant temperature, a change in light did not induce any change in zooxanthellae (zoox) and chlorophyll (Chla+c2) concentrations (mean 3.7 x 10(6) zoox cm(-2) and 14.1 microg cm(-2), respectively); however, chlorophyll concentrations significantly increased under low light and temperature, probably in order to maintain a sufficient level of autotrophy. Maximal gross photosynthesis (Pgmax) as well as the saturation irradiance (Ek) and the respiration rate (R) were, however, significantly higher at 250 micromol m(-2) s(-1) compared to the lower light treatments, independently of temperature conditions. Acclimation to high light appeared to be partly driven by a change in the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) capacity of the algal cells, and to a maximal rate of photon utilization. Conversely, under low light conditions, coral polyps presented a lower Ek, but also lower respiration rates, which correspond to a decrease in the energy expenditure. This ability to acclimate to different light conditions, might allow C. caespitosa to rapidly regulate its autotrophic rate in the different light conditions encountered in its natural habitats.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTThe dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium contains numerous genetically distinct lineages that appear ?morphologically cryptic?. However, detailed morphological assessments of plate formulae visible in the motile phase (mastigote) of two distantly related Symbiodinium spp., representing Clades ?A? and ?E?, were recently shown to be different. While there are several formally described species in Clade A, genetic evidence indicates that many more remain uncharacterized. We focused on closely related phylogenetic lineages within this group to examine whether differences in morphology can be used together with genetic and ecological evidence to describe new species. We found fixed differences in nuclear (internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and large subunit rDNA), chloroplast (cp23S) and mitochondrial (cob) gene sequences from cultured and field-collected samples of Symbiodinium microadriaticum (sensu Trench {\&} Blank, 1987) and Symbiodinium sp. associated predominantly with giant clams and Pacific Cassiopea jellyfish (comprising members of the ITS2 A3 lineage, sensu LaJeunesse 2001). Amphiesmal plate tabulations were formulated for the strain of S. microadriaticum (CCMP2464) used by Trench {\&} Blank (1987) in their emended description, and two strains of type A3 (CCMP832 and rt-272) cultured from Indo-Pacific giant clams in the subfamily Tridacninae. The Kofoidian plate formula for type A3 consists of the small plate (x), the elongated amphiesmal vesicle (EAV), 5?, 6a, 8??, 9?11s, a 2-row cingulum, 7??? and 3???? (and occasionally 2????), and is different from S. microadriaticum, which has a plate formula of x, EAV, 4?, 5a, 8??, 9?13s, a 2-row cingulum, 6??? and 2????. Based on morphological and genetic comparisons, we recognized Symbiodinium tridacnidorum sp. nov., a new Indo-Pacific species. The plate arrangement exhibited by S. microadriaticum appears to be more similar to the distantly related S. natans (also in Clade A). When the tabulations for all three Clade A species are compared with S. voratum (Clade E), the amount of morphological differentiation between species does not correspond to their degree of genetic divergence.},

Coral health depends on a fragile partnership with intracellular dinoflagellate symbionts. We argue here that progress in understanding coral biology requires intensive study of the cellular processes underlying this symbiosis. Such study will inform us on how the coral symbiosis will be affected by climate change, mechanisms driving coral bleaching and disease, and the coevolution of this symbiosis in the context of other host-microbe interactions. Drawing lessons from the broader history of molecular and cell biology and the study of other host-microbe interactions, we argue that a model-systems approach is essential for making effective progress in understanding coral cell biology. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In a previous paper (Goreau, 1959a) a method was described for the direct determination of calcium deposition in madreporarian corals and other calcareous reef building organisms by the use of radioactive calcium-45. In these initial experiments calcification rates were measured under a variety of controlled con- ditions in the laboratory, but no information was obtained as to whether these were comparable with growth rates of corals in the open reef. Preliminary results suggested that growth in the natural environment is faster than that which we determined under laboratory conditions. In order to study this possibility more extensively we modified our method to allow direct assessment of calcium deposition in hermatypic corals under conditions approximating those found in the reef. For test organisms we selected fifteen of the most important West Indian shallow water hermatypic coelenterates, among which were included thirteen Madreporaria and two of the Milleporina.2 These species were all collected from actively growing shallow reefs near Lime and Rackham Cays, located respectively two and four miles southeast of Port Royal, Jamaica, W. I. A general review of the abundance and distribution of these corals together with a description of Jamaican coral reefs has been published elsewhere (Goreau, 1959b)},

The ITS sequences were also highly variable, but base composition and secondary structure prediction indicate that divergent sequence variants are unlikely to be pseudogenes. The pattern of variation was unusual in several other respects: (1) two distinct ITS2 types were detected in both A. hyacinthus and A. cytherea, species known to hybridize in vitro with high success rates, and a putative intermediate ITS2 form was also detected in A. cytherea; (2) A. valida was found to contain highly (29{\{}{\%}{\}}) diverged ITS1 variants; and (3) A. longicyathus contained two distinct 5.8S rDNA types.

abstract = {Species boundaries among five sympatric coral species of the Indo-Pacific Acropora aspera group were examined by a combination of in vitro breeding trials, comparisons of spawning times and DNA sequence analysis of ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (rDNA ITS) and 5.8S regions. The breeding trials showed that reproductive compatibility exists between at least some colonies of all the species pairs tested, suggesting a large potential for natural hybridization and introgression. The Acropora ITS regions exhibited extremely high levels of variability (up to approximately 62{\{}{\%}{\}} for ITS1, approximately 11{\{}{\%}{\}} for 5.8S and approximately 43{\{}{\%}{\}} for ITS2), but most of the variation was shared among four of the five species, A. millepora, A. papillare, A. pulchra and A. spathulata, consistent with extensive introgression. Phylogenetic analyses did not resolve these four species as distinct clusters across a wide biogeographic region stretching from the southern Great Barrier Reef to Papua New Guinea. However, most colonies of the fifth species, A. aspera, constituted a distinct clade in phylogenetic analyses. This is consistent with our observations of a semi-permeable temporal barrier involving differences in spawning times between this and the other four species. Although the majority of colonies of all five species generally spawned within 90 min of each other, in two out of four years, gametes were absent prior to mass spawning episodes from at least some A. aspera colonies. Hence, our data suggest that transient reproductive barriers may be the result of year-to-year variation in the date of spawning and that this difference in spawning time contributes to the genetic structure detected among Acropora species in this group. Occasional leakage through the reproductive barrier was confirmed by the observation of A. aspera xA. pulchra F1 hybrids, identified based on additivity of ITS sequences.},

abstract = {Coral species in a similar habitat often show different bleaching susceptibilities. It is not understood which partner of coral–zooxanthellae complexes is responsible for differential stress susceptibility. Stress susceptibilities of in hospite and isolated zooxanthellae from five species of corals collected from shallow water in Okinawa were compared.To estimate stress susceptibility,we measured themaximum quantum yields (Fv/Fm)of in hospite and isolated zooxanthellae after 3-h exposure to either 28 or 34 jC at various light intensities and their recovery after 12 h under dim light at 26 jC. Significant reduction in photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) of photosystem II (PSII) was observed in in hospite zooxanthellae exposed to high light intensity (1000 Amol quanta m? 2 s? 1), while PSII activity of isolated zooxanthellae decreased significantly even at a lower light intensity (70 Amol quanta m? 2 s? 1). The recovery of the PSII activity after 12 h was incomplete in both in hospite and isolated zooxanthellae, indicating the presence of chronic photoinhibition. The stress susceptibility of isolated zooxanthellae was more variable among species than in hospite zooxanthellae. The order of stress susceptibility among the five coral species was different between in hospite and isolated zooxanthellae. The present results suggest that the host plays a significant role in determining bleaching susceptibility of corals, though zooxanthellae from different host have different stress susceptibilities.},

These methods are becoming very important tools for the identification of Brucella, at the species level and recently also at the biovar level. These techniques require minimum biological containment and can provide results in a very short time. In addition, genetic fingerprinting of isolates aid in epidemiological studies of the disease and its control. PCR-based methods are more useful and practical than conventional methods used to identify Brucella spp., and new methods for Brucella spp. identification and typing are still being developed. However, the sensitivity, specificity, and issues of quality control and quality assurance using these methods must be fully validated on clinical samples before PCR can be used in routine laboratory testing for brucellosis.},

abstract = {The Mantel test is widely used to test the linear or monotonic independence of the elements in two distance matrices. It is one of the few appropriate tests when the hypothesis under study can only be formulated in terms of distances; this is often the case with genetic data. In particular, the Mantel test has been widely used to test for spatial relationship between genetic data and spatial layout of the sampling locations. We describe the domain of application of the Mantel test and derived forms. Formula development demonstrates that the sum-of-squares (SS) partitioned in Mantel tests and regression on distance matrices differs from the SS partitioned in linear correlation, regression and canonical analysis. Numerical simulations show that in tests of significance of the relationship between simple variables and multivariate data tables, the power of linear correlation, regression and canonical analysis is far greater than that of the Mantel test and derived forms, meaning that the former methods are much more likely than the latter to detect a relationship when one is present in the data. Examples of difference in power are given for the detection of spatial gradients. Furthermore, the Mantel test does not correctly estimate the proportion of the original data variation explained by spatial structures. The Mantel test should not be used as a general method for the investigation of linear relationships or spatial structures in univariate or multivariate data. Its use should be restricted to tests of hypotheses that can only be formulated in terms of distances.},

abstract = {Coevolutionary outcomes between interacting species are predicted to vary across landscapes, as environmental conditions, gene flow, and the strength of selection vary among populations. Using a combination of molecular, experimental, and field approaches, we describe how broad-scale patterns of environmental heterogeneity, genetic divergence, and regional adaptation have the potential to influence coevolutionary processes in the Linum marginale-Melampsora lini plant-pathogen interaction. We show that two genetically and geographically divergent pathogen lineages dominate interactions with the host across Australia, and demonstrate a hybrid origin for one of the lineages. We further demonstrate that the geographic divergence of the two lineages of M. lini in Australia is related to variation among lineages in virulence, life-history characteristics, and response to environmental conditions. When correlated with data describing regional patterns of variation in host resistance diversity and mating system these observations highlight the potential for gene flow and geographic selection mosaics to generate and maintain coevolutionary diversification in long-standing host-pathogen interactions.},

abstract = {Coral bleaching, in which corals become visibly pale and typically lose their endosymbiotic zooxanthel- lae (Symbiodinium spp.), increasingly threatens coral reefs worldwide. While the proximal environmental triggers of bleaching are reasonably well understood, considerably less is known concerning physiological and ecological factors that might exacerbate coral bleaching or delay recovery. We report a bleaching event in Belize during September 2004 in which Montastraea spp. corals that had been previously grazed by corallivorous par- rotfishes showed a persistent reduction in symbiont density compared to intact colonies. Additionally, grazed corals exhibited greater diversity in the genetic composition of their symbiont communities, changing from uniform ITS2 type C7 Symbiodinium prior to bleaching to mixed assemblages of Symbiodinium types post-bleaching. These results suggest that chronic predation may exacerbate the influence of environmen- tal stressors and, by altering the coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis, such abiotic-biotic interactions may contribute to spatial variation in bleaching processes.},

abstract = {* The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. * The presentation of ‘variance explained' (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. * One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). * Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. * This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.},

abstract = {Hybridization between genetically distinguishable taxa provides opportunities for investigating speciation. While hybridization is a common phenomenon in various macro-organisms, natural hybridization among micro-eukaryotes is barely studied. Here we used a nuclear and a chloroplast molecular marker and morphology to demonstrate the presence of natural hybrids between two genetically and morphologically distinct varieties of the marine planktonic diatom Pseudo-nitzschia pungens (vars. pungens and cingulata) in a contact zone in the northeast Pacific. Cloning and sequencing of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer region revealed strains containing ribotypes from both varieties, indicating hybridization. Both varieties were found to also have different chloroplast-encoded rbcL sequences. Hybrid strains were either hetero- or homoplastidial, as demonstrated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, which is in accordance with expectations based on the mode of chloroplast inheritance in Pseudo-nitzschia. While most hybrids are probably first generation, there are also indications for further hybridization. Morphologically, the hybrids resembled var. pungens for most characters rather than having an intermediate morphology. Further research should focus on the hybridization frequency, by assessing the spatial and temporal extent of the contact zone, and hybrid fitness, to determine the amount of gene flow between the two varieties and its evolutionary consequences.},

We asked whether the frequency of warm temperature anomalies is positively related to the frequency of coral disease across 1,500 km of Australia's Great Barrier Reef. We used a new high-resolution satellite dataset of ocean temperature and 6 y of coral disease and coral cover data from annual surveys of 48 reefs to answer this question. We found a highly significant relationship between the frequencies of warm temperature anomalies and of white syndrome, an emergent disease, or potentially, a group of diseases, of Pacific reef-building corals. The effect of temperature was highly dependent on coral cover because white syndrome outbreaks followed warm years, but only on high ({\textgreater}50{\%}) cover reefs, suggesting an important role of host density as a threshold for outbreaks. Our results indicate that the frequency of temperature anomalies, which is predicted to increase in most tropical oceans, can increase the susceptibility of corals to disease, leading to outbreaks where corals are abundant.},

Whereas some authors focus on the potential of hybridization as a source of genetic variation, functional novelty and new species, others argue against any important role, because reduced fitness would typically render hybrids an evolutionary dead end. By drawing on recent developments in the genetics and ecology of hybridization and on principles of ecological speciation theory, I develop a concept that reconciles these views and adds a new twist to this debate. Because hybridization is common when populations invade new environments and potentially elevates rates of response to selection, it predisposes colonizing populations to rapid adaptive diversification under disruptive or divergent selection. I discuss predictions and suggest tests of this hybrid swarm theory of adaptive radiation and review published molecular phylogenies of adaptive radiations in light of the theory.},

We exposed 27 isolates of symbiotic dinoflagellates simultaneously to UV-B/A and PAR, and subsequently determined the MAAs present in cell extracts and in the media. The algae used included 24 isolates of Symbiodinium spp. originating from jellyfishes, sea anemones, zoanthids, scleractinians, octocorals, and bivalves, and three others in the genera Gymnodinium, Gloeodinium and Amphidinium from a jellyfish, an hydrocoral and a flatworm, respectively. In this study, all of the phylotype A Symbiodinium spp. synthesized up to three identified MAAs. None of the 11 cultured phylotypes B and C Symbiodinium spp. synthesized MAAs. The three non-Symbiodinium symbionts also synthesized up to three MAAs. The results support a conclusion that phylotype A Symbiodinium spp. have a high predilection for the synthesis of MAAs, while phylotypes B and C do not. Synthesis of MAAs by symbiotic dinoflagellates in culture does not appear to relate directly to depths or to the UV exposure regimes from which the consortia were collected.},

abstract = {Fundamental to most genetic analysis is availability of genomic DNA of adequate quality and quantity. Because DNA yield from human samples is frequently limiting, much effort has been invested in developing methods for whole genome amplification (WGA) by random or degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR. However, existing WGA methods like degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR suffer from incomplete coverage and inadequate average DNA size. We describe a method, termed multiple displacement amplification (MDA), which provides a highly uniform representation across the genome. Amplification bias among eight chromosomal loci was less than 3-fold in contrast to 4-6 orders of magnitude for PCR-based WGA methods. Average product length was {\textgreater}10 kb. MDA is an isothermal, strand-displacing amplification yielding about 20-30 microg product from as few as 1-10 copies of human genomic DNA. Amplification can be carried out directly from biological samples including crude whole blood and tissue culture cells. MDA-amplified human DNA is useful for several common methods of genetic analysis, including genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms, chromosome painting, Southern blotting and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, subcloning, and DNA sequencing. MDA-based WGA is a simple and reliable method that could have significant implications for genetic studies, forensics, diagnostics, and long-term sample storage.},

Two new species in the genus Symbiodinium Freudenthal 1962 are described using an integra- tive evolutionary genetics approach: Symbiodinium minutum sp. nov. are harbored by widespread tropical anemones in the genus Aiptasia; and Symbiodinium psygmophilum sp. nov. are harbored by subtropical and temperate stony corals (e.g., Astrangia, Cladocora, and Oculina) from the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Both new species are readily distinguished from each other by phylogenetic disparity and reciprocal monophyly of several nucleic acid sequences including nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2, single copy microsatellite flanker Sym15, mitochondrial cytochrome b, and the chloroplast 23S rRNA gene. Such molecular evidence, combined with well-defined differences in cell size, physiology (thermal tolerance), and ecology (host compatibility) establishes these organisms as distinct species. Future descriptions of Symbiodinium spp. will need to emphasize genetics-based descrip- tions because significant morphological overlap in this group obscures large differences in ecology and evolutionary divergence. By using molecular evidence based on conserved and rapidly evolving genes ana- lyzed from a variety of samples, species boundaries are defined under the precepts of Evolutionary and Biological Species Concepts without reliance on an arbitrary genetic distance metric. Because ecological specialization arises through genetic adaptations, the Ecological Species Concept can also serve to delimit many host-specific Symbiodinium spp. Key index words: dinoflagellate; species recognition; Symbiodinium;},

abstract = {-The occurrence of zooxanthellae in Recent scleractinian corals is strongly correlated with their growth form, corallite size, and degree of morphological integration of corallites. The great majority of zooxanthellate corals are multiserial with small, highly integrated corallites, whereas most corals lacking zooxanthellae are solitary or uniserial colonial forms with large, poorly integrated corallites. Beginning in the Jurassic, fossil scleractinian faunas are morphologically similar to Recent faunas dominated by zoox- anthellate species, strongly implying that most scleractinians contained zooxanthellae by that time. Evidence for Siluro-Devonian tabulates and Triassic scleractinians is equivocal but still suggests the presence of zooxanthellae in these corals. In contrast, morphological evidence suggests that rugosan corals lacked zooxanthellae. Most populations of Recent zooxanthellate corals contribute to reef formation, but many do not. Similarly, fossil corals interpreted to contain zooxanthellae on morphological grounds did not always form reefs. Recent reef formation depends upon a host of environmental factors that have little to do with the possession of zooxanthellae per se. Coral morphology should be a better predictor of the presence of zooxanthellae in fossil corals than their association with reefs},

The observations were most consistent with a heterothallic. multiple-group mating system, requiring more than two groups to explain the pairwise crossing data. Despite the ability of strains from different populations to produce resting cysts, the viability of progeny was highly variable among interpopulation crosses. Cysts from all crosses showed a high germination percentage (93-100{\%}) and released a swimming planomeiocyte. Crosses between different Tasmanian strains, and those between Spanish and Japanese strains, showed high post-meiotic viability (65{\%} and 80{\%}, respectively). However, progeny from Tasmanian-Spanish and Tasmanian-Japanese crosses showed very low post-meiotic viability (5-10{\%}), indicating a higher level of somatic incompatibility between these populations. Significant differences in sexual life-history (e.g. rate of gamete formation and cyst dormancy) were also noted between interpopulation crosses, suggesting genetically determined strain- and population-level differences. The crossing data indicate a high level of mating diversity within the Australian population and show that the Japanese and Spanish populations are more closely related to each other than to Australian populations; this is supported by molecular studies. Implications for the proposed global dispersal of G. catenatum and the use of interbreeding to examine population relationships are discussed. New measures are proposed for examining strain (RC,) and population (RC,) levels of reproductive compatibility, respectively, which are calculated as the product of proportion of successful matings (termed the compatibility index) and the number of cysts produced (average vigour) in successful crosses.},

abstract = {Some reef-building corals have been shown to respond to environmental change by shifting the composition of their algal symbiont (genus Symbiodinium) communities. These shifts have been proposed as a potential mechanism by which corals might survive climate stressors, such as increased temperatures. Conventional molecular methods suggest this adaptive capacity may not be widespread because few (∼25{\%}) coral species have been found to associate with multiple Symbiodinium clades. However, these methods can fail to detect low abundance symbionts (typically less than 10-20{\%} of the total algal symbiont community). To determine whether additional Symbiodinium clades are present, but are not detected using conventional techniques, we applied a high-resolution, real-time PCR assay to survey Symbiodinium (in clades A-D) from 39 species of phylogenetically and geographically diverse scleractinian corals. This survey included 26 coral species thought to be restricted to hosting a single Symbiodinium clade ('symbiotic specialists'). We detected at least two Symbiodinium clades (C and D) in at least one sample of all 39 coral species tested; all four Symbiodinium clades were detected in over half (54{\%}) of the 26 symbiotic specialist coral species. Furthermore, on average, 68 per cent of all sampled colonies within a given coral species hosted two or more symbiont clades. We conclude that the ability to associate with multiple symbiont clades is common in scleractinian (stony) corals, and that, in coral-algal symbiosis, 'specificity' and 'flexibility' are relative terms: specificity is rarely absolute. The potential for reef corals to adapt or acclimatize to environmental change via symbiont community shifts may therefore be more phylogenetically widespread than has previously been assumed.},

The majority of the bacteria identified by this method were novel species and belonged to a wide variety of microbial groups, with cyanobacteria and Lx-proteobacteria being the most abundant. In contrast, the bacteria cultured from the same M. franksi samples were closely related to previously described bacteria and consisted mostly of) gamma -proteobacteria. These results show that the microbial diversity associated with corals can be greatly underestimated when relying exclusively on culture-based methods. Our analyses also showed that one a-proteobacteria species was present in all M. franksi samples isolated from five reefs separated by up to 10 km. This finding is suggestive of a specific microbe-coral association.},

abstract = {Dinoflagellates are a group of protists whose genome differs from that of other eukaryotes in terms of size (contains up to 250pg per haploid cell), base composition, chromosomal organization, and gene expression. But rDNA gene mapping of the active nucleolus in this unusual eukaryotic genome has not been carried out thus far. Here we used FISH in dinoflagellate species belonging to the genus Alexandrium (genome sizes ranging from 21 to 170 pg of DNA per haploid genome) to localize the sequences encoding the 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNA genes. The results can be summarized as follows: 1) Each dinoflagellate cell contains only one active nucleolus, with no hybridization signals outside it. However, the rDNA organization varies among species, from repetitive clusters forming discrete nuclear organizer regions (NORs) in some to specialized "ribosomal chromosomes" in other species. The latter chromosomes, never reported before in other eukaryotes, are mainly formed by rDNA genes and appeared in the species with the highest DNA content. 2) Dinoflagellate chromosomes are first characterized by several eukaryotic features, such as structural differentiation (centromere-like constrictions), size differences (dot chromosomes), and SAT (satellite) chromosomes. 3) NOR patterns prove to be useful in discriminating between cryptic species and life cycle stages in protists. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Coral reefs have suffered long-term decline due to a range of anthropogenic disturbances and are now also under threat from climate change. For appropriate management of these vulnerable and valuable ecosystems it is important to understand the factors and processes that determine their resilience and that of the organisms inhabiting them, as well as those that have led to existing patterns of coral reef biodiversity. The scleractinian (stony) corals deposit the structural framework that supports and promotes the maintenance of biological diversity and complexity of coral reefs, and as such, are major components of these ecosys- tems. The success of reef-building corals is related to their obligate symbiotic association with dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium. These one-celled algal symbionts (zoo- xanthellae) live in the endodermal tissues of their coral host, provide most of the host's energy budget and promote rapid calcification. Furthermore, zooxanthellae are the main primary producers on coral reefs due to the oligotrophic nature of the surrounding waters. In this review paper, we summarize and critically evaluate studies that have employed genetics and/or molecular biology in examining questions relating to the evolution and ecology of reef-building corals and their algal endosymbionts, and that bear relevance to coral reef conservation. We discuss how these studies can focus future efforts, and examine how these approaches enhance our understanding of the resilience of reef-building corals.},

The addition of a thick inoculum to a nitrogen–deprived medium results in the occurrence of anisogamous sexual fusion within the first three days in the new culture. Planozygotes, large “lumpy” cells recognizable by their four flagella, may persist up to 2 wk before forming a smooth–walled, oval hypnozygote. The latter resembles cysts released asexually by ecdysis but has a slightly thicker wall. Viable cysts resembling hypnozygotes (zygotic cysts), but with reduced photosynthetic pigmentation, have been isolated from natural murine sediments in Hidden Basin, British Columbia, and a culture (strain NEPCC–254) was initiated from excysted individuals. Zygotic cysts of NEPCC–71 remained encysted in the light at 17 C for 8 wk before excysting. The presence of a ventral pen with toxicity in the latter strain indicates that the taxonomy of G. tamarensis-like organisms is still in a stale of flux and the criteria for recognition of G. excavata (Braarud) Balech as a separate species are not satisfactory as presently formulated.},

The objectives of the meeting were to, a) explain what is known of certain coral reef problem domains, that is, as they relate to anthropogenic stress and coral reef response, b) determine which in situ monitoring instruments would help in these research problems, and, c) to begin to provide a dialog to enhance current expert system modules, or develop new ones, to facilitate interpretation of (i.e., model) those factors thought to be conducive to stimulating a particular event (e.g., coral bleaching, coral growth). The work presented at this Think Tank represents a milestone in marking the status of important topics in coral reef research today, and indeed new research directions have already begun. The present NOAA Technical Memorandum details the salient points of the invitees' presentations through summaries, relevant bibliographic citations, and links (at the bottom of the first page of each presentation summary) to their PowerPoint presentations on the World-Wide Web. The document is arranged to show the meeting agenda followed by the presentations in the order in which they were given.

No intraspecific variation was detected with respect to any of the cpDNA markers developed in this study. The cpDNA markers obtained were subsequently used to examine the parentage of P. densata, a putative Tertiary hybrid between P. tabulaeformis and P. yunnanensis. The analysis demonstrated for the first time that P. densata populations accommodate chloroplast genomes of P. tabulaeformis and P. yunnanensis, which strongly supports earlier suggestions of the hybrid origin of this species. It appears that P. densata represents a stabilized natural hybrid that has become adapted to high mountain environments where neither of the parental species can normally grow.},

abstract = {We investigated the effect of elevated partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) on the photosynthesis and growth of four phylotypes (ITS2 types A1, A13, A2, and B1) from the genus Symbiodinium, a diverse dinoflagellate group that is important, both free-living and in symbiosis, for the viability of cnidarians and is thus a potentially important model dinoflagellate group. The response of Symbiodinium to an elevated pCO2 was phylotype-specific. Phylotypes A1 and B1 were largely unaffected by a doubling in pCO2; in contrast, the growth rate of A13 and the photosynthetic capacity of A2 both increased by,60{\%}. In no case was there an effect of ocean acidification (OA) upon respiration (dark- or light-dependent) for any of the phylotypes examined. Our observations suggest that OA might preferentially select among free-living populations of Symbiodinium, with implications for future symbioses that rely on algal acquisition from the environment (i.e., horizontal transmission). Furthermore, the carbon environment within the host could differentially affect the physiology of different Symbiodinium phylotypes. The range of responses we observed also highlights that the choice of species is an important consideration in OA research and that further investigation across phylogenetic diversity, for both the direction of effect and the underlying mechanism(s) involved, is warranted.

Using molecular and ecological data, we found that the alpine-adapted butterflies in the genus Lycaeides are the product of hybrid speciation. The alpine populations possess a mosaic genome derived from both L. melissa and L. idas and are differentiated from and younger than their putative parental species. As predicted, adaptive traits may allow for persistence in the environmentally extreme alpine habitat and reproductively isolate these populations from their parental species.},

This is exempliWed in this study of the Montastraea annularis species complex from six sites on the Mesoamerican Reef, Belize and nine sites in the Bocas del Toro archipelago, Panama. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) was used to identify the zooxanthellae. In Belize (M. annularis), Symbiodinium B (79{\{}{\%}{\}} of the colonies), Symbiodinium A, and Symbiodinium C were observed. In Panama (primarily M. franksi, but also M. annularis and M. faveolata), there was greater diversity and evenness with Symbiodinium A, B, C, C (a new symbiont) and D all being common in at least some host/habitat combinations. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordinations showed that distribution patterns of symbionts across sites are best explained by enclosure (relative inXuence of open ocean vs. coastal water) and total suspended solids. Because members of clade D are known to be temperature resistant and Symbiodinium C was found in environments characterized by high sedimentation, these Panamanian reefs may have importance from a management perspective as reservoirs of corals better able to tolerate human impacts.},

abstract = {Cryptoperidiniopsoids are an unclassified group of delicately thecate heterotrophic dinoflagellates known to be common in eastern U.S. estuarine wa- ters. Over the past 10 years cryptoperidiniopsoids were isolated from different geographical regions and cultured with cryptophyte algal prey. In the seven clonal isolates examined, reproduction was strongly linked to the availability of prey cells. The dinoflagellates phagocytized the contents of prey cells through a tube-like peduncle, similarly as close relatives of Pfiesteria spp. and several other het- erotrophic species. Cell division occurred while en- cysted, most commonly yielding two biflagellated offspring. Abundant fusing gametes, phagotrophic planozygotes, and cysts with a pronounced nuclear cyclosis characterized persistent sexuality. Cysts with nuclear cyclosis produced two flagellated offspring cells. The resistance of reproductive cysts to antimi- crobial treatments was examined, and a simple high- yield technique was developed for population syn- chronization while ridding the dinoflagellates of most contaminating vacuolar prey DNA and external con- taminants. The DNA content and population DNA profiles of synchronously excysted cryptoperidiniop- soids from different isolates were measured using flow cytometry and were related to the life history of these and other dinoflagellates. Cryptophyte-fed cul- tures with versus without extracellular bacteria were compared, and bacteria apparently promoted cryp- toperidiniopsoid feeding and growth. Externally bac- teria-free dinoflagellates were cultured in media enriched with dissolved organic nutrients, and nutri- tional benefit may have occurred in some treatments. The potential for mixotrophic nutrition from mainte- nance of cryptophyte chloroplasts was examined us- ing flow cytometrically sorted cells, but evidence of kleptoplastidy was not found in these isolates under the conditions imposed.

abstract = {Reef-building corals and many other cnidarians are symbiotic with dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium. It has long been known that the endosymbiotic algae transfer much of their photosynthetically fixed carbon to the host and that this can provide much of the host's total energy. However, it has remained unclear which metabolite(s) are directly translocated from the algae into the host tissue. We reexamined this question in the small sea anemone Aiptasia using labeling of intact animals in the light with (13)C-bicarbonate, rapid homogenization and separation of animal and algal fractions, and analysis of metabolite labeling by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found labeled glucose in the animal fraction within 2 min of exposure to (13)C-bicarbonate, whereas no significant labeling of other compounds was observed within the first 10 min. Although considerable previous evidence has suggested that glycerol might be a major translocated metabolite, we saw no significant labeling of glycerol within the first hour, and incubation of intact animals with (13)C-labeled glycerol did not result in a rapid production of (13)C-glucose. In contrast, when Symbiodinium cells freshly isolated from host tissue were exposed to light and (13)C-bicarbonate in the presence of host homogenate, labeled glycerol, but not glucose, was detected in the medium. We also observed early production of labeled glucose, but not glycerol, in three coral species. Taken together, the results suggest that glucose is the major translocated metabolite in dinoflagellate-cnidarian symbiosis and that the release of glycerol from isolated algae may be part of a stress response.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTWe describe Symbiodinium necroappetens sp. nov. found predominantly in diseased or thermally damaged tissues in some reef corals of the Greater Caribbean. Small, albeit fixed, differences in the ribosomal DNA (ITS2 and LSU) and cytochrome b (cob) indicate that S. necroappetens is evolutionarily separate, but closely related to S. microadriaticum (members of Clade A). However, haplotype sequences of the non-coding region of the psbA minicircle are highly divergent, signifying that the degree of genetic divergence between these sibling lineages is far greater than indicated by changes in rDNA. Small morphological differences also support the delineation of this species. The Kofoidian plate formula for S. necroappetens (x-plate, EAV, 4?, 5a, 8??, 9-11s, 21c, 6???, 2????, PE) is generally the same as described for S. microadriaticum, except for the number of cingulum plates (21 vs 22?24), but plate shapes and configurations differ. Nuclear and mitochondrial volumes calculated from ultrastructural serial sections (published previously) also distinguish it from S. microadriaticum and S. pilosum. There are significant physiological differences in the response of S. necroappetens to high pCO2 and thermal stress when compared with S. microadriaticum, indicating that large functional differences exist even among closely related species. This species appears to be necrotrophic rather than mutualistic. Before it was recognized as a distinct entity, reports on its ecology contributed to the supposition that members of Clade A Symbiodinium were opportunistic. Available evidence indicates that S. necroappetens exists at low environmental background levels, but may ?proliferate? selectively in artificial growth media, or emerge opportunistically in bleached coral colonies during early recovery from severe stress, or in diseased necrotic tissues, especially in colonies of the Orbicella (formerly Monstastraea) annularis complex. However, S. necroappetens fails to persist at detectable levels as populations of the typical symbiont recover. The description of this species raises awareness of the broad functional and ecological diversity exhibited by members of this large dinoflagellate genus.},

abstract = {This study was aimed at detecting apoptosis as a post-phagocytic mechanism of symbiont selection during the onset of symbiosis in larvae of the scleractinian coral Fungia scutaria. Larvae were infected with one of three Symbiodinium types: freshly isolated homologous ITS-type C1f from adult F. scutaria, heterologous C31 from adult Montipora capitata, known to be unable to successfully colonize F. scutaria larvae, and type B1 from the symbiotic sea anemone Aiptasia spp. Apoptosis was detected by the activation of caspases, enzymes specific to apoptosis. Caspase activity was measured in situ by cleavage of a specific fluorophore and detection with confocal microscopy. At 6 h post infection, there was a significant increase in caspase activation in gastrodermal cells in C31-infected larvae, compared with larvae infected with C1f or B1 types. Compared with control larvae infected with C31, which had decreased infection rates present by 24 h post infection, when C31-infected larvae were incubated with a broad-scale caspase inhibitor, the per cent of larvae infected with C31 did not significantly decrease over time. This indicates that the reduction in infection success observed in untreated C31-infected larvae can be rescued with inhibition of caspases and apoptosis. This suggests the presence of a post-phagocytic recognition mechanism. Larvae infected with freshly isolated B1 retained infection success over time compared with C31-infected larvae, suggesting that there is host discrimination between heterologous algae. Initiation of this post-phagocytic response may occur more readily with a highly specific heterologous symbiont type such as C31, compared with a generalist heterologous type such as clade B1.},

abstract = {The discovery that nuclear DNA content varies widely among species, and even within species, was unexpected because it was thought that the number of genes required for an organism should be common across taxa. We now know that the bulk of nuclear DNA content variation is caused by repetitive DNA sequences characterized according to the nature of repeat (tandem vs dispersed) or chromosomal location/mechanism of replication (pericentromeric, telomeric or subtelomeric, microsatellites, minisatellites, satellites, transposable elements, retroelements). Variation in repetitive DNA, manifested as variation in nuclear DNA content, has been shown to have broad ecological and life-history consequences. For example, large genome size appears to limit fitness in extreme environmental conditions. Within species, variation in DNA content has been coupled to growth and development, such as maturation time in crop species. In Silene latifolia, DNA content is negatively correlated with flower size, a character that, in turn, has well documented ecological significance. These intraspecific studies suggest a connection between repetitive DNA and quantitative genetic determination of continuous characters. Novel insights into mechanisms by which repetitive DNA influences phenotype will lead to models of evolutionary change that extend well beyond the conventional view of evolution by allelic substitution.},

Sediment samples and physico-chemical data were collected along an enrichment gradient radiating out from three Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) farms in New Zealand. HTS of environmental DNA and RNA (eDNA/eRNA) resulted in 1,875,300 sequences that clustered into 349 Operational Taxonomic Units. Strong correlations were observed among various biotic indices calculated from MI data and normalized fourth-root transformed HTS data. Correlations were stronger using eRNA compared to eDNA data. Quantile regression spline analyses identified 12 key foraminiferal taxa that have potential to be used as bioindicator species.

abstract = {Marine ecosystems worldwide are under threat with many fish species and populations suffering from human over-exploitation. This is greatly impacting global biodiversity, economy and human health. Intriguingly, marine fish are largely surveyed using selective and invasive methods, which are mostly limited to commercial species, and restricted to particular areas with favourable conditions. Furthermore, misidentification of species represents a major problem. Here, we investigate the potential of using metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) obtained directly from seawater samples to account for marine fish biodiversity. This eDNA approach has recently been used successfully in freshwater environments, but never in marine settings. We isolate eDNA from ½-litre seawater samples collected in a temperate marine ecosystem in Denmark. Using next-generation DNA sequencing of PCR amplicons, we obtain eDNA from 15 different fish species, including both important consumption species, as well as species rarely or never recorded by conventional monitoring. We also detect eDNA from a rare vagrant species in the area; European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus). Additionally, we detect four bird species. Records in national databases confirmed the occurrence of all detected species. To investigate the efficiency of the eDNA approach, we compared its performance with 9 methods conventionally used in marine fish surveys. Promisingly, eDNA covered the fish diversity better than or equal to any of the applied conventional methods. Our study demonstrates that even small samples of seawater contain eDNA from a wide range of local fish species. Finally, in order to examine the potential dispersal of eDNA in oceans, we performed an experiment addressing eDNA degradation in seawater, which shows that even small (100-bp) eDNA fragments degrades beyond detectability within days. Although further studies are needed to validate the eDNA approach in varying environmental conditions, our findings provide a strong proof-of-concept with great perspectives for future monitoring of marine biodiversity and resources.},

Laboratory experiments showed that motile zooxantheltae were attracted to intact aposymbiotic host animals, but not to starved symbiotic hosts. Fed symbiotic hosts and brine shrimp (Artemia sp.) nauplii also attracted motile zooxanthellae. The attraction of these zooxanthellae was directly correlated with nitrogen levels in the seawater surrounding the hosts; thus ammonia and possibly nitrate could be attractants. Brine shrimp nauplii, acting as "intermediate" hosts actively ingested both motile and non-motile zooxanthellae. The ingested zooxanthellae tended to remain morphologically unaltered during and after passage through the gut of the brine shrimp. Capture and ingestion of brine shrimp containing zooxanthellae by aposymbiotic scyphistomae of the jelly- fish Cassiopeia xamachana led to infection of the scyph- istomae with zooxanthellae. Zooxanthellae isolated from 17 different species of coelenterates and molluscs could be transferred via brine shrimp to the endodermal cells of the scyphistomae. However only 10 of these isolates persisted to establish a permanent association with C. xamachana. Scyphistomae in suspensions of motile zooxanthellae responded by a classical coelenterate feed- ing response, which may facilitate ingestion of the po- tential symbionts and establishment of a symbiosis,},

abstract = {Despite the enormous theoretical attention given to the evolutionary consequences of sexual reproduction, the validity of the key assumptions on which the theory depends rarely has been evaluated. It is often argued that a reduced ability to purge deleterious mutations condemns asexual lineages to an early extinction. However, most well characterized asexual lineages fail to exhibit the high levels of neutral allelic divergence expected in the absence of recombination. With purely descriptive data, it is difficult to evaluate whether this pattern is a consequence of the rapid demise of asexual lineages, an unusual degree of mutational stability, or recombination. Here, we show in mutation-accumulation lines of asexual Daphnia that the rate of loss of nucleotide heterozygosity by ameiotic recombination is substantially greater than the rate of introduction of new variation by mutation. This suggests that the evolutionary potential of asexual diploid species is not only a matter of mutation accumulation and reduced efficiency of selection, and [corrected] it underscores the limited utility of using neutral allelic divergence as an indicator of ancient asexuality.},

abstract = {A protein determination method which involves the binding of Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 to protein is described. The binding of the dye to protein causes a shift in the absorption maximum of the dye from 465 to 595 nm, and it is the increase in absorption at 595 nm which is monitored. This assay is very reproducible and rapid with the dye binding process virtually complete in approximately 2 min with good color stability for 1 hr. There is little or no interference from cations such as sodium or potassium nor from carbohydrates such as sucrose. A small amount of color is developed in the presence of strongly alkaline buffering agents, but the assay may be run accurately by the use of proper buffer controls. The only components found to give excessive interfering color in the assay are relatively large amounts of detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, Triton X-100, and commercial glassware detergents. Interference by small amounts of detergent may be eliminated by the use of proper controls. ?? 1976.},

abstract = {Reef corals are sentinels for the adverse effects of rapid global warming on the planet's ecosystems. Warming sea surface temperatures have led to frequent episodes of bleaching and mortality among corals that depend on endosymbiotic micro-algae (Symbiodinium) for their survival. However, our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary response of corals to episodes of thermal stress remains inadequate. For the first time, we describe how the symbioses of major reef-building species in the Caribbean respond to severe thermal stress before, during and after a severe bleaching event. Evidence suggests that background populations of Symbiodinium trenchi (D1a) increased in prevalence and abundance, especially among corals that exhibited high sensitivity to stress. Contrary to previous hypotheses, which posit that a change in symbiont occurs subsequent to bleaching, S. trenchi increased in the weeks leading up to and during the bleaching episode and disproportionately dominated colonies that did not bleach. During the bleaching event, approximately 20 per cent of colonies surveyed harboured this symbiont at high densities (calculated at less than 1.0{\%} only months before bleaching began). However, competitive displacement by homologous symbionts significantly reduced S. trenchi's prevalence and dominance among colonies after a 2-year period following the bleaching event. While the extended duration of thermal stress in 2005 provided an ecological opportunity for a rare host-generalist symbiont, it remains unclear to what extent the rise and fall of S. trenchi was of ecological benefit or whether its increased prevalence was an indicator of weakening coral health.},

abstract = {The sea anemone Anthopleura aureoradiata (Carlgren), which harbours symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae), is abundant on mudflats and rocky shores around New Zealand. We measured the potential for particulate nitrogen uptake from sediment by A. aureoradiata and the subsequent consequences of this uptake on the nitrogen status of its zooxanthellae. Sediment was rinsed, labelled with (15NH4)2SO4, and provided to anemones at low (0.23gml-1) and high (1.33gml-1) sediment loads for 6h. Both anemone tissues and zooxanthellae became enriched with 15N. Enrichment of anemone tissues was similar at both high and low sediment loads, but the zooxanthellae became more enriched at the lower load. This was presumably because the uptake of ammonium, arising from host catabolism, by zooxanthellae is light driven and because the anemones at the lower load were able to extend their tentacles into the light while those at the higher load were not. The influence of sediment uptake on the nitrogen status of the zooxanthellae was determined by measuring the extent to which 20??M NH4+ enhanced the rate of zooxanthellar dark carbon fixation above that seen in filtered seawater (FSW) alone; the ammonium enhancement ratio (AER) was expressed as [dark NH4+ rate/dark FSW rate], where 'rate' refers to C fixation and a ratio of 1.0 or less indicates nitrogen sufficiency. When anemones were starved with and without rinsed sediment in nitrogen-free artificial seawater for 8weeks, zooxanthellar nitrogen deficiency became apparent at 2-4weeks and reached similar levels in both treatments (AER={\~{}}2). In contrast, anemones fed 5 times per week for 8weeks with Artemia nauplii were nitrogen sufficient (AER=1.03). In the field, zooxanthellae from mudflat anemones were largely nitrogen sufficient (AER=1.26), while nitrogen deficient zooxanthellae were present in anemones from a rocky intertidal site (AER=2.93). These results suggest that, while there was evidence for particulate nitrogen uptake, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (especially ammonium) in interstitial pore water may be a more important source of nitrogen for the zooxanthellae in mudflat anemones, and may explain the marked difference in nitrogen status between the mudflat and rocky shore populations. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {While for pathogen clones singly occupying a host it may pay to adopt a relatively avirulent host exploitation strategy, clones sharing a host have a conflict of interest that favors more virulent strategies. As the number of infections per host depends on the force of infection and the force of infection, in turn, depends on prevailing virulence, evolutionary analysis needs to be integrated with population dynamics. A full-fledged approach requires exceedingly large capacities for bookkeeping of the infection events and is therefore difficult to establish. In this article the host-pathogen interaction is studied for the simple case in which hosts may become at most doubly infected. It appears that evolution and population dynamics give rise to a feedback mechanism. When double infections are frequent, increased virulence is favored; but when pathogens become more virulent, the force of infection will decrease, favoring lower virulence again. Thus, evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) virulence depends on the interaction within hosts as well as on the interaction at the population level. As current models of host- microparasite interactions take only first infections into account, they may be inappropriate for evolutionary analyses, which would require modeling of within-host competition between strains and thus of multiple infections},

abstract = {Mutualisms between reef-building corals and endosymbiotic dinoflagellates are particularly sensitive to environmental stress, yet the ecosystems they construct have endured major oscillations in global climate. During the winter of 2008, an extreme cold-water event occurred in the Gulf of California that bleached corals in the genus Pocillopora harbouring a thermally 'sensitive' symbiont, designated Symbiodinium C1b-c, while colonies possessing Symbiodinium D1 were mostly unaffected. Certain bleached colonies recovered quickly while others suffered partial or complete mortality. In most colonies, no appreciable change was observed in the identity of the original symbiont, indicating that these partnerships are stable. During the initial phases of recovery, a third species of symbiont B1(Aiptasia), genetically identical to that harboured by the invasive anemone, Aiptasia sp., grew opportunistically and was visible as light-yellow patches on the branch tips of several colonies. However, this symbiont did not persist and was displaced in all cases by C1b-c several months later. Colonies with D1 were abundant at inshore habitats along the continental eastern Pacific, where seasonal turbidity is high relative to offshore islands. Environmental conditions of the central and southern coasts of Mexico were not sufficient to explain the exclusivity of D1 Pocillopora in these regions. It is possible that mass mortalities associated with major thermal disturbances during the 1997-1998 El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation eliminated C1b-c holobionts from these locations. The differential loss of Pocillopora holobionts in response to thermal stress suggests that natural selection on existing variation can cause rapid and significant shifts in the frequency of particular coral-algal partnerships. However, coral populations may take decades to recover following episodes of severe selection, thereby raising considerable uncertainty about the long-term viability of these communities.},

Molecular methods such as microarrays and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may be used to estimate presence or expression of different genes (e.g., 16S rDNA and nifH) in environmental samples; however, to be quantitative, these methods require a reproducible and efficient DNA extraction protocol. Using picogreen DNA quantification, real-time PCR, and an internal DNA standard, we step-wise examined and optimized a protocol for DNA extraction from centrifuged or filtered seawater samples (vol. 2 to 300 mL). Sample volume had a pronounced effect on DNA extraction efficiency showing that comparison of samples with different volumes is problematic. The duration of enzyme treatment lysozyme and proteinase K) significantly influenced the DNA extraction efficiency. Dissolved DNA contributed significantly to total DNA when extracted from small filtering volumes ({\textless}10 mL). Addition of a coprecipitant yeast tRNA) improved the precipitation of low-concentration DNA from 13{\%} to 89{\%}. When tested on various seawater samples, as well as on isolates, the optimized extraction protocol was found to be highly reproducible with an average extraction efficiency for seawater samples of 92{\%} and for isolates of 96{\%}. The quantitative outcome and the high extraction efficiency of the presented extraction protocol will be of value to future studies based on DNA extracted from seawater samples.},

abstract = {The internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA of 33 species of genus Paeonia (Paeoniaceae) were sequenced. In section Paeonia, different patterns of nucleotide additivity were detected in 14 diploid and tetraploid species at sites that are variable in the other 12 species of the section, suggesting that reticulate evolution has occurred. Phylogenetic relationships of species that do not show additivity, and thus ostensibly were not derived through hybridization, were reconstructed by parsimony analysis. The taxa presumably derived through reticulate evolution were then added to the phylogenetic tree according to additivity from putative parents. The study provides an example of successfully using ITS sequences to reconstruct reticulate evolution in plants and further demonstrates that the sequence data could be highly informative and accurate for detecting hybridization. Maintenance of parental sequences in the species of hybrid origin is likely due to slowing of concerted evolution caused by the long generation time of peonies. The partial and uneven homogenization of parental sequences displayed in nine species of putative hybrid origin may have resulted from gradients of gene conversion. The documented hybridizations may have occurred since the Pleistocene glaciations. The species of hybrid origin and their putative parents are now distantly allopatric. Reconstruction of reticulate evolution with sequence data, therefore, provides gene records for distributional histories of some of the parental species.},

abstract = {Ocean acidiWcation is one of the key threats facing coral reef ecosystems, but there are few estimates of spatial and temporal variability in pH among reef habitats. The present study documents levels of spatial variability in pH among coral reef habitats (9 to 10), among locations separated by 100's km of latitude and between east (Great Barrier Reef, GBR) and west (Ningaloo Reef) coasts of Australia. DiVerences were found in pH between inshore and oVshore waters along Ningaloo Reef (means 8.45, 8.53, respectively). Replicate assessments here ranged from 8.22 to 8.64. On the GBR, the range of values over all habitats and replicates was 0.39 pH units (7.98 to 8.37). There were minor but signiWcant diVerences of 0.05 pH units between 5 consecutive days for habitats on average. Highest pH was recorded in Wlamentous algal beds maintained by the dam- selWsh Dischistodus perspicillatus. Lowest pH was found in water extracted from sand-dwelling goby holes. While there were marked changes in pH over a 48-h sampling period among 4 habitats at Lizard Island (GBR), there was little evidence of a diel trend. Understanding how pH varies at scales that are relevant to organisms that live on shallow coral reefs is crucial for the design and interpretation of experiments that test the eVects on organisms of the changes in water chemistry predicted to aVect oceans in the future.},

abstract = {Compensatory base changes (CBCs) in internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) rDNA secondary structures correlate with Ernst Mayr's biological species concept. This hypothesis also referred to as the CBC species concept recently was subjected to large-scale testing, indicating two distinct probabilities. (1) If there is a CBC then there are two different species with a probability of ∼0.93. (2) If there is no CBC then there is the same species with a probability of ∼0.76. In ITS2 research, however, the main problem is the multicopy nature of ITS2 sequences. Most recently, 454 pyrosequencing data have been used to characterize more than 5000 intragenomic variations of ITS2 regions from 178 plant species, demonstrating that mutation of ITS2 is frequent, with a mean of 35 variants per species, respectively per individual organism. In this study, using those 454 data, the CBC criterion is reconsidered in the light of intragenomic variability, a proof of concept, a necessary criterion, expecting no intragenomic CBCs in variant ITS2 copies. In accordance with the CBC species concept, we could demonstrate that the probability that there is no intragenomic CBC is ∼0.99.},

abstract = {New species may be formed through hybridization and without an increase in ploidy. The challenge is for hybrid derivatives to escape the homogenizing effects of gene flow from parental species. The mechanisms hypothesized to underlie this process were modelled using a computer simulation. The model is of recombinational speciation, in which chromosomal rearrangements between parental species result in poor fertility of F1 hybrids, but through recombination, novel homozygous types are formed that have restored fertility. In simulations, stable populations bearing the recombinant karyotypes originated frequently and were maintained when the fertility of F1 hybrids was high. However, this high rate of origination was offset by low genetic isolation, and lower F1 hybrid fertility increased the evolutionary independence of derived populations. In addition, simulations showed that ecological and spatial isolation were required to achieve substantial reproductive isolation of incipient species. In the model, the opportunity for ecological isolation arose as a result of adaptation to extreme habitats not occupied by parental species, and any form of spatial isolation (e.g. founder events) contributed to genetic isolation. Our results confirmed the importance of the combination of factors that had been emphasized in verbal models and illustrate the trade-off between the frequency at which hybrid species arise and the genetic integrity of incipient species.},

Crossing experiments between clonal isolates were conducted in order to determine mating-type affiliations and the frequency of successful zygote germination. The frequency of gametic recognition was not clearly linked to the proximity of the geographical origin of isolates, nor was there a significant relationship between the frequency of gametic recognition and the rate of zygote germination. There was a tendency for gametic recognition incompatibility among clonal isolates to relax somewhat with time in culture. These observations can best be interpreted in terms of a polar complementarity model, with active gametic recognition sites at the cell surface. In many basic features, sexual reproduction in this dinoflagellate resembles that observed in certain species of ciliates and foraminifera.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Classical morphological taxonomy places the approximately 1400 recognized species of Scleractinia (hard corals) into 27 families, but many aspects of coral evolution remain unclear despite the application of molecular phylogenetic methods. In part, this may be a consequence of such studies focusing on the reef-building (shallow water and zooxanthellate) Scleractinia, and largely ignoring the large number of deep-sea species. To better understand broad patterns of coral evolution, we generated molecular data for a broad and representative range of deep sea scleractinians collected off New Caledonia and Australia during the last decade, and conducted the most comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis to date of the order Scleractinia. METHODOLOGY: Partial (595 bp) sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene were determined for 65 deep-sea (azooxanthellate) scleractinians and 11 shallow-water species. These new data were aligned with 158 published sequences, generating a 234 taxon dataset representing 25 of the 27 currently recognized scleractinian families. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: There was a striking discrepancy between the taxonomic validity of coral families consisting predominantly of deep-sea or shallow-water species. Most families composed predominantly of deep-sea azooxanthellate species were monophyletic in both maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses but, by contrast (and consistent with previous studies), most families composed predominantly of shallow-water zooxanthellate taxa were polyphyletic, although Acroporidae, Poritidae, Pocilloporidae, and Fungiidae were exceptions to this general pattern. One factor contributing to this inconsistency may be the greater environmental stability of deep-sea environments, effectively removing taxonomic "noise" contributed by phenotypic plasticity. Our phylogenetic analyses imply that the most basal extant scleractinians are azooxanthellate solitary corals from deep-water, their divergence predating that of the robust and complex corals. Deep-sea corals are likely to be critical to understanding anthozoan evolution and the origins of the Scleractinia.},

@book{MaynardSmith1998,
abstract = {Interest in the study of evolution, particularly the population genetic and molecular aspects, has been very marked in recent years and is likely to continue, engendered to a considerable extent by the remarkable advances in knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of inheritance. Although this book is intended primarily for advanced undergraduates in the biological sciences, the scope and style of its treatment make it a very suitable source of evolutionary enlightenment for any potential reader with the necessary background knowledge to understand its contents. Professor Maynard Smith assumes in readers some basic knowledge of classical genetics and elementary algebra, the meaning of differentiation in calculus, and some basic probability and statistics, but as he writes - "if you can't stand algebra, keep out of evolutionary biology". It is thus a book about the mechanisms of evolution. The first six chapters deal respectively with evolution by natural selection (Darwin, Lamarck et al.), population models, evolution in diploid populations (Hardy-Weinberg, etc.), variability of natural populations, evolution at more than one locus and quantitative genetics (V = VG + VE, etc.). The next chapter deals with the topic for which the author is best known, namely evolutionary game theory. There follow chapters on the following: finite and structured populations (inbreeding, genetic drift, neutral molecular evolution, etc.); evolution in structured populations, prokaryotes and the eukaryote genome; sex and recombination and some genetic consequences of separation into sexes; and a final chapter on macroevolution. There are problems to be solved at the end of chapters (with answers at the end of the book), and some mathematical derivations and other factual material are separated from the main text in boxes. An unusual but praiseworthy feature is the addition of computer projects at the end of some chapters. These can be carried out on a microcomputer. Another good feature is that the subject index has the pagination of definitions in bold face type. I note from the publisher's information in the book's preliminary pages that a reprinting was required in the year of publication. This does not surprise me, as the book is attractively produced, competitively priced, and gives an authoritative, up-to-date treatment of the main topics of current thought and research on evolutionary genetics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The deep sea floor is considered one of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth. Recent environmental DNA surveys based on clone libraries of rRNA genes confirm this observation and reveal a high diversity of eukaryotes present in deep-sea sediment samples. However, environmental clone-library surveys yield only a modest number of sequences with which to evaluate the diversity of abyssal eukaryotes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we examined the richness of eukaryotic DNA in deep Arctic and Southern Ocean samples using massively parallel sequencing of the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) V9 hypervariable region. In very small volumes of sediments, ranging from 0.35 to 0.7 g, we recovered up to 7,499 unique sequences per sample. By clustering sequences having up to 3 differences, we observed from 942 to 1756 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) per sample. Taxonomic analyses of these OTUs showed that DNA of all major groups of eukaryotes is represented at the deep-sea floor. The dinoflagellates, cercozoans, ciliates, and euglenozoans predominate, contributing to 17{\%}, 16{\%}, 10{\%}, and 8{\%} of all assigned OTUs, respectively. Interestingly, many sequences represent photosynthetic taxa or are similar to those reported from the environmental surveys of surface waters. Moreover, each sample contained from 31 to 71 different metazoan OTUs despite the small sample volume collected. This indicates that a significant faction of the eukaryotic DNA sequences likely do not belong to living organisms, but represent either free, extracellular DNA or remains and resting stages of planktonic species. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In view of our study, the deep-sea floor appears as a global DNA repository, which preserves genetic information about organisms living in the sediment, as well as in the water column above it. This information can be used for future monitoring of past and present environmental changes.},

abstract = {When transport in networks follows the shortest paths, the union of all shortest path trees G union or logical sum SPT can be regarded as the "transport overlay network." Overlay networks such as peer-to-peer networks or virtual private networks can be considered as a subgraph of G union or logical sum SPT. The traffic through the network is examined by the betweenness Bl of links in the overlay G union or logical sum SPT. The strength of disorder can be controlled by, e.g., tuning the extreme value index alpha of the independent and identically distributed polynomial link weights. In the strong disorder limit (alpha--{\textgreater}0), all transport flows over a critical backbone, the minimum spanning tree (MST). We investigate the betweenness distributions of wide classes of trees, such as the MST of those well-known network models and of various real-world complex networks. All these trees with different degree distributions (e.g., uniform, exponential, or power law) are found to possess a power law betweenness distribution Pr[Bl=j] approximately j(-c). The exponent c seems to be positively correlated with the degree variance of the tree and to be insensitive of the size N of a network. In the weak disorder regime, transport in the network traverses many links. We show that a link with smaller link weight tends to carry more traffic. This negative correlation between link weight and betweenness depends on alpha and the structure of the underlying topology.},

abstract = {Plant disease epidemics resulting from introductions of exotic fungal plant pathogens are a well known phenomenon. An associated risk-that accelerated pathogen evolution may be occurring as a consequence of genetic exchange between introduced, or introduced and resident, fungal pathogens-is largely unrecognized. This is, in part, because examples of natural, interspecific hybridization in fungi are very rare. Potential evolutionary developments range from the acquisition of new host specificities to emergence of entirely new pathogen taxa. We present evidence from cytological behavior, additive nucleotide bases in repetitive internal transcribed spacer regions of the rRNA-encoding DNA (rDNA), and amplified fragment length polymorphisms of total DNA that a new, aggressive Phytophthora pathogen of alder trees in Europe comprises a range of heteroploid-interspecific hybrids involving a Phytophthora cambivora-like species and an unknown taxon similar to Phytophthora fragariae. The hybrids' marked developmental instabilities, unusual morphological variability, and evidence for recombination in their internal transcribed spacer profiles indicates that they are of recent origin and that their evolution is continuing. The likelihood of such evolutionary events may be increasing as world trade in plants intensifies. However, routine diagnostic procedures currently in use are insufficiently sensitive to allow their detection.},

abstract = {In populations that are small and asexual, mutations with slight negative effects on fitness will drift to fixation more often than in large or sexual populations in which they will be eliminated by selection. If such mutations occur in substantial numbers, the combined effects of long-term asexuality and small population size may result in substantial accumulation of mildly deleterious substitutions. Prokaryotic endosymbionts of animals that are transmitted maternally for very long periods are effectively asexual and experience smaller effective population size than their free-living relatives. The contrast between such endosymbionts and related free-living bacteria allows us to test whether a population structure imposing frequent bottlenecks and asexuality does lead to an accumulation of slightly deleterious substitutions. Here we show that several independently derived insect endosymbionts, each with a long history of maternal transmission, have accumulated destabilizing base substitutions in the highly conserved 16S rRNA. Stabilities of Domain I of this subunit are 15-25{\%} lower in endosymbionts than in closely related free-living bacteria. By mapping destabilizing substitutions onto a reconstructed phylogeny, we show that decreased ribosomal stability has evolved separately in each endosymbiont lineage. Our phylogenetic approach allows us to demonstrate statistical significance for this pattern: becoming endosymbiotic predictably results in decreased stability of rRNA secondary structure.},

abstract = {Zooxanthellae are unicellular algae that occur as endosymbionts in many hundreds of common marine invertebrates. The issue of zooxanthella diversity has been difficult to address. Most zooxanthellae have been placed in the dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium as one or several species that are not easily distinguished. We compared Symbiodinium and nonsymbiotic dinoflagellates using small ribosomal subunit RNA sequences. Surprisingly, small ribosomal subunit RNA diversity within the genus Symbiodinium is comparable to that observed among different orders of nonsymbiotic dinoflagellates. These data reinforce the conclusion that Symbiodinium-like zooxanthellae represent a collection of distinct species and provide a precedent for a molecular genetic taxonomy of the genus Symbiodinium.},

abstract = {Epichlo{\"{e}} endophytes are fungal symbionts of grasses that span a continuum including asexual mutualists that are vertically transmitted, obligately sexual pathogens that are horizontally transmitted, and mixed-strategy symbionts with both mutualistic and pathogenic capabilities. Here we show that processes of genome evolution differ markedly for the different symbiont types. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis was conducted of a broad taxonomic, ecological and geographical sample of sexual and asexual isolates, in which were identified and sequenced alleles of genes for beta-tubulin (tub2) and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1), and microsatellite alleles were identified by length polymorphisms. The majority of asexual isolates had two or three alleles of most loci, but every sexual isolate had only single alleles for each locus. Phylogenetic analysis of tub2 and tef1 indicated that in all instances of multiple alleles in an isolate, the alleles were derived from different sexual species. It is concluded that, whereas horizontally transmissible species had haploid genomes and speciation occurred cladistically, most of the strictly seedborne mutualists were interspecific hybrids with heteroploid (aneuploid or polyploid) genomes. Furthermore, the phylogenetic evidence indicated that, in at least some instances, hybridization followed rather than caused evolution of the strictly seedborne habit. Therefore, the abundance of hybrid species among grass endophytes, and their prevalence in many host populations suggests a selective advantage of hybridization for the mutualistic endophytes.},

At all light levels, rates of cell division and photosynthesis were determined, as were cell volumes, pigmentation (including chlorophyll a, chlorophyll c2, peridinin, fl- carotene and xanthophylls), and carbon and nitrogen con- tent. Low light-induced changes in pigmentation were evident to varying degrees in all three algal strains, although alterations in the photosynthesis-irradiance relations were distinctly different in each strain. The algae from T. maxima show the least photoadaptive capability, and seem to photoadapt by changing photosynthetic unit (PSU) size. Algae from A. ?ulchella appear to adapt by changing PSU number, while algae from M. verrucosa appear to photoadapt by changes in the activities of CO2- fixing enzymes or electron transport systems. These are the first observations that demonstrate functional differences in different strains of S. microadriaticum. The adaptive capabilities of the algae appear to correlate well with the ecological distribution of their respective hosts. The study was made from July 1981 through December 1982.},

abstract = {The physiology exhibited by symbioses between dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae) and hosts such as reef corals may be dictated by the host, the symbiont, or the synergistic effect of both partners. We compared the oxygen fluxes of two laboratory populations of the symbiotic sea anemone Aiptasia pallida, originally collected from Bermuda and Florida. A. pallida from Bermuda contained clade B zooxanthellae and A. pallida from Florida hosted clade A zooxanthellae. Both freshly isolated zooxanthellae and intact anemones were compared as a function of light intensity at culture (25°C) and elevated (32°C, 34°C) temperatures. Zooxanthellae isolated from the Florida anemones had higher net photosynthetic rates at 32°C (Pmax: 6.2 ± 0.9 µmol O2 h-1 µg chlorophyll a [Chl a]-1 vs. 0.7 ± 3.6 for Bermuda algae), with the Bermuda algae exhibiting pronounced photoinhibition at higher irradiances. At 34°C, the clade A (Florida) symbionts had lower net photosynthesis than at 32°C (Pmax: 3.6 ± 2.2 µmol O2 h-1 µg Chl a-1), but the Bermuda symbionts had high rates of net O2 consumption at all irradiances. The intact Bermuda anemones, however, exhibited much less pronounced effects at elevated temperatures than did the isolated Bermuda zooxanthellae. Bermuda anemones containing the Florida symbionts had higher net oxygen fluxes than those with the Bermuda symbionts at elevated temperatures and irradiances. This study demonstrates that the physiology of the intact symbiosis is dictated by both partners and that studies of the intact symbiosis may not fully reveal the thermal liability of the algae. },

abstract = {The symbiotic dinoflagellates of corals and other marine invertebrates (Symbiodinium) are essential to the development of shallow-water coral reefs. This genus contains considerable genetic diversity and a correspond-ing range of physiological and ecological traits. Most genetic variation arises through the accumulation of somatic mutations that arise during asexual reproduction. Yet growing evidence suggests that occasional sexual reproductive events also occur within, and perhaps between, Symbiodinium lineages, further contributing to the pool of genetic variation available for evolutionary adaptation. Intra-genomic variation can therefore arise from both sexual and asexual reproductive processes, making it difficult to discern its underlying causes and consequences. We used quantitative PCR targeting the ITS2 locus to estimate proportions of genetically homo-geneous symbionts and intra-genomically variable Sym-biodinium (IGV Symbiodinium) in the reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis at Lord Howe Island, Australia. We then sampled colonies through time and at a variety of spatial scales to find out whether the distribution of these symbionts followed patterns consistent with niche partitioning. Estimated ratios of homogeneous to IGV Symbiodinium varied between colonies within sites (metres to tens of metres) and between sites separated by hundreds to thousands of metres, but remained stable within colonies through time. Symbiont ratios followed a temperature gradient, with the local thermal maximum emerging as a negative predictor for the estimated proportional abun-dance of IGV Symbiodinium. While this pattern may result from fine-scale spatial population structure, it is consistent with an increased susceptibility to thermal stress, sug-gesting that the evolutionary processes that generate IGV (such as inter-lineage recombination and the accumulation of somatic mutations at the ITS2 locus) may have impor-tant implications for the fitness of the symbiont and that of the coral host.},

@article{Trench1993b,
abstract = {The field of microalgal-invertebrate symbiosis has gradually been undergoing some significant conceptual changes. The concept of low genetic diversity among symbiotic microalgae and high diversity among animal hosts has been challenged, and shown to be inaccurate. An increasingly high taxonomic diversity of microalgae are now recognized as forming symbioses with a high diversity of invertebrates, in marine and freshwater habitats, in benthic and pelagic communities. Information from a wide range of sources indicates that there is symbiont-host specificity in these symbioses at the species level, a realization that is completely in agreement with the patterns observed in other mutualistic and in parasitic symbioses. There has been a general misunderstanding that the less restrictive specificity observed under laboratory conditions is equivalent to that occurring in the natural environment. The mechanism of selectivity underlying the expressed specificity of microalgal-invertebrate symbioses is unknown, but evidence supporting the concept of molecular signalling between symbionts and hosts is rapidly accumulating. Such molecular ''cross-talk'' between symbionts and hosts has now been documented in bacteria-legume symbioses, and has also been implicated in interactions between plants and bacterial pathogens. Many aspects of the physiology, biochemistry and ecology of microalgal-invertebrate symbioses are better appreciated with the realization that functional diversity probably parallels genetic (taxonomic) diversity, and many of the apparently controversial aspects of the biology of microalgal-invertebrate symbioses can be reconciled by embracing this idea. Based on recent new evidence on the structure and composition of the photosynthetic apparatus of symbiotic dinoflagellates, it is apparent that some of the paradigms of functional, and ultimately, ecological aspects of the symbioses involving these algae will have to be modified. Of the various subdisciplines of the field, the most controversial, and indeed confusing, is that pertaining to the acquisition and utilization of nitrogen and phosphorus. I have attempted to review the various aspects of microalgal-invertebrate symbioses pertaining to their taxonomy, genetic diversity and evolution, morphology, biochemistry and physiology, as concisely as possible. As I believe that the field lacks an overall general theory that would guide future research directions, I conclude the article with a speculative discourse which hopefully may serve as a focal point. I believe that most of the ideas expressed, though not always supported by tangible evidence, are cast in the form of potentially testable hypotheses.},

This 'coral species problem' is an impediment to understanding the evolution and biodiversity of this important and threatened group of organisms. We examined the evolution of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and mitochondrial markers (COI, putative control region) in Porites, one of the most taxonomically challenging and ecologically important genera of reef-building corals. RESULTS: Nuclear and mitochondrial markers were congruent, clearly resolving many traditionally recognized species; however, branching and mounding varieties were genetically indistinguishable within at least two clades, and specimens matching the description of 'Porites lutea' sorted into three genetically divergent groups. Corallite-level features were generally concordant with genetic groups, although hyper-variability in one group (Clade I) overlapped and obscured several others, and Synarea (previously thought to be a separate subgenus) was closely related to congeners despite its unique morphology. Scanning electron microscopy revealed subtle differences between genetic groups that may have been overlooked previously as taxonomic characters. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the coral skeleton can be remarkably evolutionarily plastic, which may explain some taxonomic difficulties, and obscure underlying patterns of endemism and diversity.},

The main aims of this study were to: (i) monitor coral health and spatial patterns of coral bleaching response at the Solitary Islands Marine Park (SIMP) and Lord Howe Island Marine Park (LHIMP), to determine variability of bleaching susceptibility among coral taxa; (ii) predict coral bleaching thresholds at 30 °S and 31.5 °S, extrapolated from published bleaching threshold data; and (iii) propose a subtropical northern New South Wales coral bleaching model from biological and physical data. Between 2005 and 2007 minor bleaching was observed in dominant coral families including Pocilloporidae, Poritidae and Dendrophylliidae in the SIMP and Pocilloporidae, Poritidae and Acroporidae (Isopora and Montipora spp.) in the LHIMP, with a clear difference in bleaching susceptibility found between sites, both within and between locations. Bleaching susceptibility was highest in Porites spp. at the most offshore island site within the SIMP during summer 2005. Patterns of subtropical family bleaching susceptibility within the SIMP and LHIMP differed to those previously reported for the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). These differences may be due to a number of factors, including temperature history and/or the coral hosts association with different zooxanthellae clades, which may have lower thermal tolerances. An analysis of published estimates of coral bleaching thresholds from the Caribbean, South Africa, GBR and central and northern Pacific regions suggests that the bleaching threshold at 30–31.5 °S ranges between 26.5–26.8 °C. This predicted threshold was confirmed by an extensive coral bleaching event on the world's southernmost coral reef at Lord Howe Island, during the 2010 austral summer season. These results imply that dominant coral taxa at subtropical reefs along the eastern Australian seaboard are highly susce},

abstract = {When corals and allied animals are deprived of their symbiotic algae, the ammonium content in their tissues rises. This is commonly interpreted as evidence for nitrogen recycling (i.e. algal assimilation of animal waste ammonium into amino acids that are released back to the animal), but it can also be explained as nitrogen conservation by the animal (i.e. reduced net ammonium production in response to the receipt of algal photosynthetic carbon). This study discriminated between these interpretations in two ways. First, the increased ammonium concentration in the sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella, caused by darkness or depletion of the alga Symbiodinium, was partially or completely reversed by supplementing the medium with organic carbon compounds (e.g. ￼-ketoglutarate). Second, the activity of the ammonium-assimilating enzyme glutamine synthetase and the concentration of protein amino acids in the free amino acid pool of the animal, which were depressed by darkness and algal depletion, were restored by exogenous carbon compounds. It is concluded that organic carbon, whether derived from algal photosynthate or exogenously, promotes the animal's capacity for ammonium assimilation and reduces ammonium production from amino acid degradation. These processes contribute to nitrogen conservation in the animal, but they confound the interpretation of various studies on nitrogen recycling by symbiotic algae.},

abstract = {Coral reefs in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) are among the most isolated in the world. This isolation has resulted in relatively low species diversity but comparatively high endemism. The dominant reef-building corals of the TEP are the Pocillopora corals, a ubiquitous Indo-Pacific genus commonly regarded as inferior reef-builder. In addition to being the dominant reef-builders in the TEP, the Pocilloporids have undergone a reproductive shift from internally brooding larvae through most of their Indo-Pacific range to free-spawning in the TEP. Using genetic data from the internally transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the nuclear ribosomal DNA gene cluster, we show here that this apparent reproductive shift coincides with interspecific hybridization among TEP Pocillopora species. We document a pattern of one-way gene flow into the main TEP reef builder P. damicornis from one or both of its TEP congeners - P. eydouxi and P. elegans. Our data provide preliminary evidence that trans-Pacific gene flow in P. damicornis between the Central and Eastern Pacific is restricted as well (Phi(ST) = 0.419, P {\textless} 0.0001). In combination, these results suggest that Eastern Pacific corals exist in relative isolation from their Central Pacific counterparts and interact with each other differently via hybridization.},

abstract = {Over the past three decades, massive bleaching events of zooxanthellate corals have been documented across the range of global distribution. Although the phenomenon is correlated with relatively small increases in sea-surface temperature and enhanced light intensity, the underlying physiological mechanism remains unknown. In this article we demonstrate that thylakoid membrane lipid composition is a key determinate of thermal-stress sensitivity in symbiotic algae of cnidarians. Analyses of thylakoid membranes reveal that the critical threshold temperature separating thermally tolerant from sensitive species of zooxanthellae is determined by the saturation of the lipids. The lipid composition is potentially diagnostic of the differential nature of thermally induced bleaching found in scleractinian corals. Measurements of variable chlorophyll fluorescence kinetic transients indicate that thermally damaged membranes are energetically uncoupled but remain capable of splitting water. Consequently, a fraction of the photosynthetically produced oxygen is reduced by photosystem I through the Mehler reaction to form reactive oxygen species, which rapidly accumulate at high irradiance levels and trigger death and expulsion of the endosymbiotic algae. Differential sensitivity to thermal stress among the various species of Symbiodinium seems to be distributed across all clades. A clocked molecular phylogenetic analysis suggests that the evolutionary history of symbiotic algae in cnidarians selected for a reduced tolerance to elevated temperatures in the latter portion of the Cenozoic.},

abstract = {Although Acropora is the most species-rich genus of the scleractinian (stony) corals, only three species occur in the Caribbean: A. cervicornis, A. palmata and A. prolifera. Based on overall coral morphology, abundance and distribution patterns, it has been suggested that A. prolifera may be a hybrid between A. cervicornis and A. palmata. The species boundaries among these three morphospecies were examined using DNA sequence analyses of the nuclear Pax-C 46/47 intron and the ribosomal DNA Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS1 and ITS2) and 5.8S regions. Moderate levels of sequence variability were observed in the ITS and 5.8S sequences (up to 5.2{\{}{\%}{\}} overall sequence difference), but variability within species was as large as between species and all three species carried similar sequences. Since this is unlikely to represent a shared ancestral polymorphism, the data suggest that introgressive hybridization occurs among the three species. For the Pax-C intron, A. cervicornis and A. palmata had very distinct allele frequencies and A. cervicornis carried a unique allele at a frequency of 0.769 (although sequence differences between alleles were small). All A. prolifera colonies examined were heterozygous for the Pax-C intron, whereas heterozygosity was only 0.286 and 0.333 for A. cervicornis and A. palmata, respectively. These data support the hypothesis that A. prolifera is the product of hybridization between two species that have a different allelic composition for the Pax-C intron, i.e. A. cervicornis and A. palmata. We therefore suggest that A. prolifera is a hybrid between A. cervicornis and A. palmata, which backcrosses with the parental species at low frequency.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dinoflagellates are an ecologically important group of protists with important functions as primary producers, coral symbionts and in toxic red tides. Although widely studied, the natural diversity of dinoflagellates is not well known. DNA barcoding has been utilized successfully for many protist groups. We used this approach to systematically sample known "species", as a reference to measure the natural diversity in three marine environments. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we assembled a large cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI) barcode database from 8 public algal culture collections plus 3 private collections worldwide resulting in 336 individual barcodes linked to specific cultures. We demonstrate that COI can identify to the species level in 15 dinoflagellate genera, generally in agreement with existing species names. Exceptions were found in species belonging to genera that were generally already known to be taxonomically challenging, such as Alexandrium or Symbiodinium. Using this barcode database as a baseline for cultured dinoflagellate diversity, we investigated the natural diversity in three diverse marine environments (Northeast Pacific, Northwest Atlantic, and Caribbean), including an evaluation of single-cell barcoding to identify uncultivated groups. From all three environments, the great majority of barcodes were not represented by any known cultured dinoflagellate, and we also observed an explosion in the diversity of genera that previously contained a modest number of known species, belonging to Kareniaceae. In total, 91.5{\%} of non-identical environmental barcodes represent distinct species, but only 51 out of 603 unique environmental barcodes could be linked to cultured species using a conservative cut-off based on distances between cultured species. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: COI barcoding was successful in identifying species from 70{\%} of cultured genera. When applied to environmental samples, it revealed a massive amount of natural diversity in dinoflagellates. This highlights the extent to which we underestimate microbial diversity in the environment.},

abstract = {Algal endosymbionts of the genus Symbiodinium play a key role in the nutrition of reef building corals and strongly affect the thermal tolerance and growth rate of the animal host. This study reports that 14 C photosynthate incorporation into juvenile coral tissues was doubled in Acropora millepora harbouring Symbiodinium C1 compared with juveniles from common parentage harbouring Symbiodinium D in a laboratory experiment. Rapid light curves performed on the same corals revealed that the relative electron transport rate of photosystem II (rETR MAX ) was 87{\%} greater in Symbiodinium C1 than in Symbiodinium D in hospite . The greater relative electron transport through photosystem II of Symbiodinium C1 is positively correlated with increased carbon delivery to the host under the applied experimental conditions ( r 2 = 0.91). This may translate into a competitive advantage for juveniles harbouring Symbiodinium C1 under certain field conditions, since rapid early growth typically limits mortality. Both symbiont types exhibited severe reductions in 14 C incorporation during a 10-h exposure to the electron transport blocking herbicide diuron (DCMU), confirming the link between electron transport through PSII and photosynthate incorporation within the host tissue. These findings advance the current understanding of symbiotic relationships between corals and their symbionts, providing evidence that enhanced growth rates of juvenile corals may result from greater translocation of photosynthates from Symbiodinium C1.},

abstract = {Coral bleaching and other diseases of corals have increased dramatically during the last few decades. As outbreaks of these diseases are highly correlated with increased sea-water temperature, one of the con- sequences of global warming will probably be mass destruction of coral reefs. The causative agent(s) of a few of these diseases have been reported: bleach- ing of Oculina patagonica by Vibrio shiloi; black band disease by a microbial consortium; sea-fan disease (aspergillosis) by Aspergillus sydowii; and coral white plague possibly by Sphingomonas sp. In addi- tion, we have recently discovered that Vibrio cora- lyticus is the aetiological agent for bleaching the coral Pocillopora damicornis in the Red Sea. In the case of coral bleaching by V. shiloi, the major effect of increasing temperature is the expression of virulence genes by the pathogen. At high summer sea-water temperatures, V. shiloi produces an adhesin that allows it to adhere to a b-galactoside-containing receptor in the coral mucus, penetrate into the coral epidermis, multiply intracellularly, differentiate into a viable-but-not-culturable (VBNC) state and produce toxins that inhibit photosynthesis and lyse the sym- biotic zooxanthellae. In black band disease, sulphide is produced at the coral–microbial biofilm interface, which is probably responsible for tissue death. Reports of newly emerging coral diseases and the lack of epidemiological and biochemical information on the known diseases indicate that this will become a fertile area of research in the interface between microbial ecology and infectious disease.},

Moreover, the genotype of Sy. trenchii (a single strain defined by ten diallelic microsatellite loci) was geneti- cally distinct fromgenotypes of Sy. ‘glynni,' also in Clade D, found abundantly in colonies of Pocillopora throughout the region. Furthermore, the strain of Sy. trenchii grouped with genotypes from the Greater Caribbean, an inbred population that was recently introduced fromthe Indo-West Pacific. This secondary introduction suggests that strains of Caribbean Sy. trenchii are capable of dispersal into new reef coral commu- nities where this symbiont does not presently exist.},

(from Belau) have been amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and sequenced. Following alignment of these complete sequences to homologous sequences from six other dinoflagellates, eight api-complexans, six ciliates, six chromophytes and oomycetes, three ascomycetes, two rhodophytes, two chlorophytes, and two myxomycetes (with Physarum polycephalum as the outgroup), phylogenetic reconstruction was conducted using Fitch and Margoliash distance, DNA maximum likelihood, and Wagner parsimony methods, with bootstrap resampling. All methods generated trees with similar topologies. The inferred “across Kingdom” phylogeny reemphasizes previous reports that show that the dinoflagellates, the apicomplexans, and the ciliates share a common ancestry and that the dinoflagellates are distantly related to the chromophyte-o{\"{o}}mycete lineage. The evidence supports the concept of a polyphyletic origin of dinoflagellate-invertebrate symbioses, as symbiotic dinoflagellates represent seven genera in at least four orders. The three symbiotic species, S. corculorum, S. meandrinae, and S. pilosum, consistent with their morphological and biochemical similarities, cluster most closely. Symbiodinium pulchrorum Trench, the symbiontfrom the Hawaiian sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella, is more distantly related to them. Gloeodinium viscum is not closely related to the Symbiodinium species. Amphidinium carterae (free-living) and A. belauense (symbiotic) also appear to be distantly related to Symbiodinium. Some symbionts (e.g. S. corculorum, S. pilosum) from distant geographic locations (the Indo-Pacific and Caribbean, respectively) were found to be very closely related, whereas S. pulchrorum and S. corculorum from the Pacific were found to be distantly related. Analyses of 10 additional symbiotic and nonsymbiotic dinoflagellates, using partial SSU rDNA sequences to generate a tentative dinoflagellate phylogeny, indicate that members of the genus Symbiodinium cluster with most of the other (free-living) dinoflagellates in the genus Gymnodinium. The genus Amphidinium, as represented by A. carterae and A. belauense, appear to be distantly related to the other members of the Gymnodiniaceae. This analysis, combined with morphological and biochemical data, indicates that the symbionts S. pulchrorum (from Aiptasia pulchella) and S. bermudense Trench (from Aiptasia tagetes) from the Indo-Pacific and Caribbean, respectively, are very closely related but are not identical.},

abstract = {Colonies of two scleractinian reef coral species, Acropora longicyathus and Acropora aspera were transplanted into patch reefs at One Tree Reef, Great Barrier Reef, Australia as part of the ENCORE experiment. These corals and colonies of A. aspera which were naturally present in the patch reefs were exposed to four treatments over two years: controls with normal seawater, elevated levels of nitrogen only, phosphorus only, or nitrogen plus phosphorus. These corals were sampled and used to determine whether gametogenic cycles and fecundity were affected by nutrient enrichment. Acropora longicyathus had a single annual gametogenic cycle. Corals exposed to elevated nitrogen produced significantly smaller and fewer eggs and contained less testes material than those which were not exposed to nitrogen. Exposure to elevated phosphorus only resulted in corals producing more but smaller eggs, and more testes material. Egg numbers of colonies from other treatments decreased as the gametogenic cycles continued, but those of the phosphorus colonies showed almost no reduction in egg numbers between the early and late stages of the gametogenic cycles. These results have important management implications for coral reefs as they demonstrate that small increases in concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus can have severe effects on reproductive activity in these species of scleractinian corals.

abstract = {The impacts of warming seas on the frequency and severity of bleaching events are well documented, but the potential for different Symbiodinium types to enhance the physiological tolerance of reef corals is not well understood. Here we compare the functionality and physiological properties of juvenile corals when experimentally infected with one of two homologous Symbiodinium types and exposed to combined heat and light stress. A suite of physiological indicators including chlorophyll a fluorescence, oxygen production and respiration, as well as pigment concentration consistently demonstrated lower metabolic costs and enhanced physiological tolerance of Acropora tenuis juveniles when hosting Symbiodinium type C1 compared with type D. In other studies, the same D-type has been shown to confer higher thermal tolerance than both C2 in adults and C1 in juveniles of the closely related species Acropora millepora. Our results challenge speculations that associations with type D are universally most robust to thermal stress. Although the heat tolerance of corals may be contingent on the Symbiodinium strain in hospite, our results highlight the complexity of interactions between symbiotic partners and a potential role for host factors in determining the physiological performance of reef corals.},

abstract = {Many theoretical advances have been made in applying probabilistic inference methods to improve the power of sequence homology searches, yet the BLAST suite of programs is still the workhorse for most of the field. The main reason for this is practical: BLAST's programs are about 100-fold faster than the fastest competing implementations of probabilistic inference methods. I describe recent work on the HMMER software suite for protein sequence analysis, which implements probabilistic inference using profile hidden Markov models. Our aim in HMMER3 is to achieve BLAST's speed while further improving the power of probabilistic inference based methods. HMMER3 implements a new probabilistic model of local sequence alignment and a new heuristic acceleration algorithm. Combined with efficient vector-parallel implementations on modern processors, these improvements synergize. HMMER3 uses more powerful log-odds likelihood scores (scores summed over alignment uncertainty, rather than scoring a single optimal alignment); it calculates accurate expectation values (E-values) for those scores without simulation using a generalization of Karlin/Altschul theory; it computes posterior distributions over the ensemble of possible alignments and returns posterior probabilities (confidences) in each aligned residue; and it does all this at an overall speed comparable to BLAST. The HMMER project aims to usher in a new generation of more powerful homology search tools based on probabilistic inference methods.},

abstract = {Reef corals (and other marine invertebrates and protists) are hosts to a group of exceptionally diverse dinoflagellate symbionts in the genus Symbiodinium. These symbionts are critical components of coral reef ecosystems whose loss during stress-related "bleaching" events can lead to mass mortality of coral hosts and associ- ated collapse of reef ecosystems. Molecular studies have shown these partnerships to be more flexible than previously thought, with different hosts and symbionts showing varying degrees of specificity in their associations. Further studies are beginning to reveal the systematic, ecological, and biogeographic underpinnings of this flexibil- ity. Unusual symbionts normally found only in larval stages, marginal environments, uncommon host taxa, or at latitudinal extremes may prove critical in understanding the long-term resilience of coral reef ecosystems to environmental perturbation. The persistence of bleaching-resistant symbiont types in affected ecosystems, and the pos- sibility of recombination among different partners following bleaching, may lead to significant shifts in symbiont community structure and elevations of future bleaching thresholds. Monitoring symbiont communities worldwide is essential to understand- ing the long-term response of reefs to global climate change because it will help resolve current controversy over the timescales over which symbiont change might occur. Symbiont diversity should be explicitly incorporated into the design of coral reef Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) where resistance or resilience to bleaching is a consideration},

abstract = {ABSTRACT. Detailed reproductive data are now available for 210 of the ca 600 identified scleractinian reef coral species. The majonty (131 species) are hermaphroditic broadcast spawners, although hermaphroditic brooders (1 1 species), gonochoristic broadcasters (37 species), and gonochoristic brood- ers (7 species) have also been reported. Characteristics of sexuality and mode of reproduction are generally conservative within species, genera, and even families, although some exceptions occur. Variation in timing or mode of reproduction in allopatric populations may represent adaptations to local environmental conditions or indicate problems in the taxonomy of some groups. Synchronous spawning of numerous species occurs on the Great Barrier Reef, while asynchrony among and withln species has been observed in the Red Sea, Caribbean, Central Pacific, Hawall, and southern Japan. Sexual reproduct{\~{}}on is the primary means for successful recruitment for some coral populations, while asexual processes may be the dominant or sole means of recruitment for these same species at the limits of their ranges. Recruitment success of different reproductive strategies may vary within and between localities, and is mediated by both biotic (predation, competition) and abiotic (environmental variability, disturb- ance) factors. Data on reproductive patterns and recruitment success may be applied to coral reef management practices. and},

abstract = {The dinoflagellate microalga Symbiodinium is the dominant algal symbiont in corals and related marine animals. To explore the incidence of mixed infections, methods employing real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were developed. In experiments focusing on Symbiodinium clades A and B, QPCR and FISH results were well correlated and generally more precise and sensitive than those from the endpoint PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP) traditionally used for this application, thus increasing the detected incidence of mixed infections. For example, the prevalence of mixed infections in the sea anemone Condylactis gigantea was 40{\{}{\%}{\}} by PCR-RFLP and 80{\{}{\%}{\}}-90{\{}{\%}{\}} by QPCR and FISH. However, the use of QPCR and FISH was limited by inter-host variation in the rRNA gene copy number per Symbiodinium cell, precluding any single conversion factor between QPCR signal and Symbiodinium cell number; and one FISH probe that gave excellent hybridization efficiency with cultured Symbiodinium yielded variable results with Symbiodinium from symbioses. After controlling for these caveats, QPCR studies revealed that field-collected hosts previously described as universally unialgal bore up to 1.6{\{}{\%}{\}} of the alternative clade. Further research is required to establish the contribution that algal cells at low density in symbiosis and external to the symbiosis make to the minor clade.},

Methods are available for searching either a single protein sequence, multiple protein sequence alignment or profile HMM against a target sequence database, and for searching a protein sequence against Pfam. The web server is designed to cater to a range of different user expertise and accepts batch uploading of multiple queries at once. All search methods are also available as RESTful web services, thereby allowing them to be readily integrated as remotely executed tasks in locally scripted workflows. We have focused on minimizing search times and the ability to rapidly display tabular results, regardless of the number of matches found, developing graphical summaries of the search results to provide quick, intuitive appraisement of them.},

(ii) Is genetic variability of A. sylvaticus higher in the Mediterranean region compared with northern Europe? (iii) Are the patterns of the postglacial colonization of Europe by woodmice similar to those presently recognized for other European species? The results provide a clear picture of the impact of the Quaternary glaciations on the genetic and geographical structure of the woodmouse. Our analyses indicate a higher genetic variability of woodmice in the Mediterranean peninsulas compared to northern Europe, suggesting a role of the former as refuge regions for this small mammal. An original pattern of postglacial colonization is proposed where the Iberian and southern France refuge populations colonized almost all European regions. The Sicilian population appears to be very differentiated and highly variable. This emphasizes the importance of this island as a 'hot spot' for the intraspecific genetic diversity of the woodmouse. Finally, woodmice in North Africa originated from southwestern Europe, most probably as a result of a recent anthropogenic introduction.},

Despite a wealth of data regarding morphological, biochemical, and behavioral differences among symbiotic dinoflagellates, knowledge concerning patterns of diversification is limited. I analyzed approximately 900 bp of the 5' end of the large-subunit ribosomal RNA gene from 14 dinoflagellate isolates: six cultured Symbiodinium specimens, two cultured symbiotic Gymnodinium, two algal samples isolated from reef-building corals, an algal sample obtained from cultures of the jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana, and three free-living Gymnodinium isolates. Results show that morphological similarities among the examined symbiotic taxa do not necessarily correspond with molecular phylogeny. The included Symbiodinium taxa represent a paraphyletic assemblage while Gymnodinium is reconstructed as a polyphyletic assemblage. Analysis indicates that all the included symbiotic dinoflagellates descended from a common, symbiotic ancestor (though within the dinoflagellates, symbiosis is a polyphyletic trait). Additionally, two free-living dinoflagellates emerge within the symbiotic clade, suggesting that the symbiotic lifestyle has been lost at least once in this group. It has been hypothesized that rates of evolution within mutualistic endosymbioses should be reduced relative to free-living taxa. However, results indicate that rates of molecular, morphological, biochemical and behavioral change are similar among branches leading to symbiotic and free-living dinoflagellates.},

abstract = {Background The symbiosis between corals and the dinoflagellate alga Symbiodinium is essential for the development and survival of coral reefs. Yet this fragile association is highly vulnerable to environmental disturbance. A coral's ability to tolerate temperature stress depends on the fitness of its resident symbionts, whose thermal optima vary extensively between lineages. However, the in hospite population genetic structure of Symbiodinium is poorly understood and mostly based on analysis of bulk DNA extracted from thousands to millions of cells. Using quantitative single-cell PCR, we enumerated DNA polymorphisms in the symbionts of the reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis, and applied a model selection approach to explore the potential for recombination between coexisting Symbiodinium populations. Results Two distinct Symbiodinium ITS2 sequences (denoted C100 and C109) were retrieved from all P. damicornis colonies analysed. However, the symbiont assemblage consisted of three distinct Symbiodinium populations: cells featuring pure arrays of ITS2 type C109, near- homogeneous cells of type C100 (with trace ITS2 copies of type C109), and those with co- dominant C100 and C109 ITS2 repeats. The symbiont consortia of some colonies consisted almost entirely of these putative C100 × C109 recombinants. Conclusions Our results are consistent with the occurrence of sexual recombination between Symbiodinium types C100 and C109. While the multiple-copy nature of the ITS2 dictates that the observed pattern of intra-genomic co-dominance may be a result of incomplete concerted evolution of intra-genomic polymorphisms, this is a less likely explanation given the occurrence of homogeneous cells of the C109 type. Conclusive evidence for inter-lineage recombination and introgression in this genus will require either direct observational evidence or a single-cell genotyping approach targeting multiple, single-copy loci.},

abstract = {Changing light environments force photoautotroph cells, including coral symbionts, to acclimate to maintain photosynthesis. Photosystem II (PSII) is subjected to photoinactivation at a rate proportional to the incident light, and cells must adjust their rates of protein repair to counter this photoinactivation. We examined PSII function in the coral symbiont Symbiodinium to determine the effect of photoacclimation on their capacity for PSII repair. Colonies of the coral Stylophora pistillata were collected from moderate light environments on the Lizard Island reef (Queensland, Australia) and transported to a local field station, where they were assigned to lower or higher light regimes and allowed to acclimate for 2 weeks. Following this photoacclimation period, the low-light acclimated corals showed greater symbiont density, higher chlorophyll per symbiont cell, and higher photosystem II protein than high-light acclimated corals did. Subsequently, we treated the corals with lincomycin, an inhibitor of chloroplastic protein synthesis, and exposed them to a high-light treatment to separate the effect of de novo protein synthesis in PSII repair from intrinsic susceptibility to photoinactivation. Low-light acclimated corals showed a sharp initial drop in PSII function but inhibition of PSII repair provoked only a modest additional drop in PSII function, compared to uninhibited corals. In high-light acclimated corals inhibition of PSII repair provoked a larger drop in PSII function, compared to uninhibited high-light corals. The greater lincomycin effects in the corals pre-acclimated to high-light show that high-light leads to an increased reliance on the PSII repair cycle.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Permutation testing is very popular for analyzing microarray data to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes; estimating false discovery rates (FDRs) is a very popular way to address the inherent multiple testing problem. However, combining these approaches may be problematic when sample sizes are unequal. RESULTS With unbalanced data, permutation tests may not be suitable because they do not test the hypothesis of interest. In addition, permutation tests can be biased. Using biased P-values to estimate the FDR can produce unacceptable bias in those estimates. Results also show that the approach of pooling permutation null distributions across genes can produce invalid P-values, since even non-DE genes can have different permutation null distributions. We encourage researchers to use statistics that have been shown to reliably discriminate DE genes, but caution that associated P-values may be either invalid, or a less-effective metric for discriminating DE genes.},

abstract = {Juveniles of a number of corals with horizontal transmission of dinoflagellate endosymbionts naturally acquire and maintain Symbiodinium types that differ from those found in adult populations. However, the duration of this early period of symbiont flexibility and successional changes leading to dominance by the characteristic adult (homologous) type are unknown. To document natural succession of Symbiodinium types within juvenile corals, we monitored Symbiodinium communities in juveniles of Acropora tenuis and Acropora millepora for 3.5 years. Juveniles originating from one of three reef populations, characterized by differing adult coral-Symbiodinium associations, were raised in a common environment. In four out of five cases, juveniles became dominated initially by a nonhomologous adult type. Changes in Symbiodinium communities associated with A. tenuis juveniles led to the establishment of the adult homologous association at approximately 3.5 years of age. These changes were not linked to the onset of reproductive maturity, but may be linked to micro-environmental changes associated with vertical growth of juvenile corals. We hypothesize that fine-tuning of specificity mechanisms takes place during ontogeny in A. tenuis, leading to the eventual establishment of the adult homologous association. However, Symbiodinium communities in A. millepora juveniles did not change significantly over the 3.5 years, potentially reflecting (i) lack of specificity, (ii) more than a 3.5-year delay in the onset of specificity, or (iii) lack of availability of the adult Symbiodinium type. This study demonstrates that juvenile corals may survive for extended periods of time with nonhomologous Symbiodinium types and that closely related species of Acropora differ in the timing of the onset of specificity for algal symbionts.},

Whereas singlet oxygen caused mainly protein modification reflected by shift of its electrophoretic mobility, action of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide resulted in generation of specific fragments. Hydroxyl radicals as the most ROS induced fast disappearance of the protein. The results substantiate the ability of ROS to cause direct scission of the D1 peptide bonds. Similar D1 modification, fragmentation and additionally cross-linking with other PSII subunits were observed during illumination or hydrogen peroxide treatment of mildly solubilized thylakoids. Peroxide-induced fragmentation did not occur in thylakoids of the strain lacking a ligand to the nonheme iron, confirming the role of this prosthetic group in the D1-specific cleavage. The D1 modification, fragmentation and cross-linking were suppressed by ROS scavengers, supporting the direct role of ROS in these phenomena. Identical symptoms of the ROS-induced D1 damage were detected in illuminated cells of Synechocystis mutants with a higher probability of ROS formation, documenting the relevance of the in vitro results for the situation in vivo.},

abstract = {Despite extensive work on the genetic diversity of reef invertebrate-dinoflagellate symbioses on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR; Australia), large information gaps exist from northern and inshore regions. Therefore, a broad survey was done comparing the community of inshore, mid-shelf and outer reefs at the latitude of Lizard Island. Symbiodinium (Freudenthal) diversity was characterized using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting and sequencing of the ITS2 region of the ribosomal DNA. Thirty-nine distinct Symbiodinium types were identified from four subgeneric clades (B, C, D, and G). Several Symbiodinium types originally characterized from the Indian Ocean were discovered as well as eight novel types (C1kk, C1LL, C3nn, C26b, C161a, C162, C165, C166). Multivariate analyses on the Symbiodinium species diversity data showed a strong link with host identity, consistent with previous findings. Of the four environmental variables tested, mean austral winter sea surface temperature (SST) influenced Symbiodinium distribution across shelves most significantly. A similar result was found when the analysis was performed on Symbiodinium diversity data of genera with an open symbiont transmission mode separately with chl a and PAR explaining additional variation. This study underscores the importance of SST and water quality related variables as factors driving Symbiodinium distribution on cross-shelf scales. Furthermore, this study expands our knowledge on Symbiodinium species diversity, ecological partitioning (including host-specificity) and geographic ranges across the GBR. The accelerating rate of environmental change experienced by coral reef ecosystems emphasizes the need to comprehend the full complexity of cnidarian symbioses, including the biotic and abiotic factors that shape their current distributions.},

Since 2008, numerous high-impact microbial metagenomic sequencing studies, which have relied on both classical and next-generation sequencing, have been published. As a result, many previously unrecognized taxa and biota have been identified, but none of these studies explored eukaryote diversity.

Most hybrid Neotyphodium species result from interspecific hybridization events between pathogenic Epichlo{\"{e}} species or co-occurring non-hybrid Neotyphodium species. Current hypotheses for the prevalence of hybrid Neotyphodium species include reduction of mutation accumulation and increased adaptive response to environmental extremes. We tested the adaptive response hypothesis by characterizing the distribution of uninfected, hybrid, and non-hybrid Neotyphodium endophytes in 24 native Arizona fescue host populations and abiotic parameters at each locality. Infection was high in all host populations ({\textgreater}70{\%}), but the majority of host populations were infected by non-hybrid Neotyphodium ({\textgreater}50{\%} on average). Principal component analysis indicates the frequency of plants infected with hybrid fungi is negatively related to soil nutrients and positively correlated with early spring moisture. Non-hybrid infected hosts are positively associated with soil nutrients and show a complex relationship with soil moisture (negative in early spring moisture, positive with late summer soil moisture). These results suggest the frequency of uninfected, hybrid, and non-hybrid infected plants is related to resource availability and abiotic stress factors. This supports the hypothesis that hybridization in asexual fungal symbionts increases host adaptability to extreme environments.},

The approach is to treat the coral reef flat as a rough surface in fully-developed turbulent flow. Input parameters to the equations are water velocity, depth, roughness height of the reef, P concentration and the C:P ratio of autotrophs. A 9-day continuous record of water velocity and depth over the windward reef flats of Enewetak Atoll is used to compare an estimate of productivity from the model to the measured productivity. The calculated productivity is 542 ?? 79 mmol C m-2 day-1 and the measured productivity is 500 mmol C m-2 day-1. Although there are few experiments to verify empirical scaling of engineering equations to reef communities, these results indicate that neither alternative external supplies of P, nor biological mechanisms of recycling appear to be required to support the high areal productivity of the Enewetak reef flats. A high flow rate of tropical surface water across reef flats can account for the elevated productivity of these communities. ?? 1992.},

Pedunculatus were inoculated with zooxanthellae freshly isolated from a range of temperate and subtropical Anthozoa. Each inoculate consisted of zooxanthellae from a single host species and was either homologous (zooxanthellae from a host of the same species as the one being inoculated) or heterologous (from a host of a different species than the one being inoculated). The densities of zooxanthellae in host tissues were determined at regular intervals. C. Pedunculatus took up homologous and heterologous zooxanthellae to similar degrees, except for zooxanthellae from the temperate Anthopleura ballii, which were taken up to a lesser extent. The densities of all zooxanthellae declined between 4 hours and 4 days after uptake, indicating that zooxanthellae were expelled, digested, or both during this period. The densities of all zooxanthellae increased between 2 and 8 weeks after inoculation, indicating zooxanthella growth. Over the entire 8-week period after uptake, densities of homologous zooxanthellae were always greater than those of heterologous zooxanthellae. Between 8 and 36 weeks after infection, densities of homologous zooxanthellae declined markedly and densities of some heterologous zooxanthellae increased further, resulting in homologous and heterologous zooxanthella densities being the same at 36 weeks. These densities were the same as those in naturally infected C. Pedunculatus of similar size. The results suggest that zooxanthellae from a range of host species and environments can establish symbioses with C. Pedunculatus and that, over long periods under laboratory conditions, heterologous zooxanthellae may populate C. Pedunculatus to the same extent as homologous zooxanthellae.},

abstract = {In symbiosis, 2 taxonomically different organisms co-exist, each pursuing their own agenda and yet, they are linked in one entity. A mutualistic symbiosis may break up if it is no longer beneficial to either one of the partners. Changing needs over time or changing environmental conditions may prompt symbiont switching. For example, corals may survive elevated temperatures by switching their algal symbionts. If switching occurs, the new combination of host and symbiont genotypes may perform better. Conversely, the partners may be fixed for life, with the degree to which the mutualism responds to changing selection pressures dictated by the existing partners. Understanding the genotypic dynamics of a mutualism is important for predicting the potential resilience of a mutualism over time and in the face of environmental perturbations. Although mutualisms tend to be characterized at the species level or higher, host-symbiont dynamics is an individual-level question, requiring individual-level analysis. We used multilocus DNA fingerprinting to examine long-term temporal and spatial symbiont change in the mutualism between the octocoral Plexaura kuna and its algal symbionts (zooxanthellae). We monitored zooxanthella genotypes within a colony for up to 10 yr, among P. kuna clonemates, across different habitats and in colonies transplanted to novel environments. In all instances, the prominent zooxanthella genotype within a P. kuna colony remained unchanged although zooxanthella genotypes varied among genetically distinct P. kuna colonies. Such tremendous temporal and spatial stability may occur in other coral hosts, influencing the reaction and survival of mutualisms during environmental change.},

On Bermuda, the coral reef dwelling anemone Condylactis gigantea bears Symbiodinium of clades A and B. At thermally variable inshore and nearshore sites, clade A predominates (as sole symbiont or in mixed infection with clade B), whereas animals at offshore sites with more uniform temperatures bear only clade B or mixed infections. Individual animals at one nearshore site monitored over a year by sampling tentacles showed increased prevalence of clade A in March-November, when sea waters were warm (average 26 degrees C), and increased clade B in November-March when cool waters prevailed (average 18.5 degrees C). In laboratory analyses of excised tentacles, the symbiosis with clade B, but not clade A, bleached at elevated temperature (32 degrees C), suggesting that thermal tolerance may contribute to the higher prevalence of clade A at inshore/nearshore sites and in the summer. The temporal changes in the algal complement were not accompanied by bleaching, and Symbiodinium density fluctuated in hosts with stable Symbiodinium composition but not in hosts with variable composition. This suggests that changes in the relative abundance of Symbiodinium clades do not require bleaching and may even protect the symbiosis from large fluctuations in algal density.},

The Phylum Alveolata comprises three major groups (ciliates, apicomplexans and dinoflagellates), the mitochondrial genomes of which have diverged widely. Even though the gene content of dinoflagellate mitochondrial genomes is reportedly comparable to that of apicomplexans, the highly fragmented and rearranged genome structures of dinoflagellates have frustrated whole genomic analysis. Consequently, non-coding sequences and gene arrangements of dinoflagellate mitochondrial genomes have not been well characterized. Here we report that the continuous assembled genome ({\{}{\~{}}{\}}326 kbp) of the dinoflagellate, Symbiodinium minutum, is AT-rich ({\{}{\~{}}{\}}64.3{\{}{\%}{\}}) and that it contains three protein-coding genes. Based upon in silico analysis, the remaining 99{\{}{\%}{\}} of the genome comprises transcriptomic non-coding sequences. RNA edited sites and unique, possible start and stop codons clarify conserved regions among dinoflagellates. Our massive transcriptome analysis shows that almost all regions of the genome are transcribed, including 27 possible fragmented rRNA genes and 12 uncharacterized small RNAs that are similar to mitochondrial RNA genes of the malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Gene map comparisons show that gene order is only slightly conserved between S. minutum and P. falciparum. However, small RNAs and intergenic sequences share sequence similarities with P. falciparum, suggesting that the function of non-coding sequences has been preserved despite development of very different genome structures.},

Here, we assess the prevalence of symbiont zonation in tropical scleractinian corals by genotyping the Symbiodinium of the 25 most common species over a large depth range (down to 60 m) on a Caribbean reef. Symbiont depth zonation was found to be common on a reef-wide scale (11 out of 25 coral species), and a dominant feature in species with the widest depth distributions. With regards to reproductive strategy, symbiont zonation was more common in broadcasting species, which also exhibited a higher level of polymorphism in the symbiont zonation (i.e. number of different Symbiodinium profiles involved). Species with symbiont zonation exhibited significantly broader depth distributions than those without, highlighting the role of symbiont zonation in shaping the vertical distributions of the coral host. Overall, the results demonstrate that coral reefs can consist of highly structured communities over depth when considering both the coral host and their obligate photosymbionts, which probably has strong implications for the extent of connectivity between shallow andmesophotic habitats.},

abstract = {One characteristic of Indo-Pacific Acropora spp. is extremely high diversity in rDNA sequences at both the species and individual levels. In order to test the hypothesis that pseudogenes may contribute to this diversity, three kinds of analyses were conducted. First, for A. millepora (the species containing the most diverse suite of rDNA types), RT-PCR was used to determine which 5.8S rDNA types are expressed. Second, as previous studies have indicated that interspecific hybridization has occurred in the genus Acropora and silencing of rDNA loci via nucleolar dominance has been shown in some cases to involve methylation, patterns of variation were examined at methylation-susceptible sites. Third, patterns of substitution at conserved sites (including those that are likely to contribute to secondary structure in rRNA) in the 5.8S rDNA were examined. These analyses consistently indicated that one rDNA sequence type present in a broad range of Indo-Pacific Acropora species is likely to consist predominantly of pseudogenes. Patterns of variation also suggest that species may differ with respect to which rDNA sequence types have been silenced and which are active. These pseudogenes are likely to have arisen as a consequence of the introduction of highly divergent rDNA types into single genomes by interspecific hybridization events, and we attribute the extreme rDNA diversity characteristic of many Acropora species to both the independent evolution of these silenced rDNA types and to the suppressive effects of high sequence diversity on homogenization processes acting on functional loci.},

In order to test this hypothesis, we have analysed partial large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences from dinoflagellates symbionts obtained from 28 foraminiferal specimens, and compared them to the corresponding sequences of Symbiodinium-like endosymbionts from various groups of invertebrates. Phylogenetic analysis of our data shows that all soritid symbionts belong to the "Symbiodinium" species complex, within which they form seven different molecular types (Frl-Fr7). Only one of these types (Fr1) branches within a group of invertebrate symbionts, previously described as type C. The remaining six types form sister groups to coral symbionts previously designed as types B, C, and D. Our data indicate a high genetic diversity and specificity of Symbiodinium-like symbionts in soritids. Except for type C, we have found no evidence for the transmission of symbionts between foraminifers and other symbiont-bearing invertebrates from the same localities. However, exchanges must have occurred frequently between the different species of Soritinae, as suggested by the lack of host specificity and some biogeographical patterns observed in symbiont distribution. Our data suggest that members of the subfamily Soritinae acquired their symbionts at least three times during their history, each acquisition being followed by a rapid diversification and independent radiation of symbionts within the foraminiferal hosts.},

abstract = {Despite the obvious efficiencies of many forms of asexual reproduction, sexual reproduction abounds. Asexual species, for the most part, are relatively short-lived offshoots of sexual ancestors. From the nineteenth century, it has been recognized that, since there is no obvious advantage to the individuals involved, the advantages of sexual reproduction must be evolutionary. Furthermore, the advantage must be substantial; for example, producing males entails a two-fold cost, compared to dispensing with them and reproducing by parthenogenetic females. There are a large number of plausible hypotheses. To me the most convincing of these are two. The first hypothesis, and the oldest, is that sexual reproduction offers the opportunity to produce recombinant types that can make the population better able to keep up with changes in the environment. Although the subject of a great deal of work, and despite its great plausibility, the hypothesis has been very difficult to test by critical observations or experiments. Second, species with recombination can bunch harmful mutations together and eliminate several in a single "genetic death." Asexual species, can eliminate them only in the same genotype in which they occurred. If the rate of occurrence of deleterious mutations is one or more per zygote, some mechanism for eliminating them efficiently must exist. A test of this mutation load hypothesis for sexual reproduction, then, is to find whether deleterious mutation rates in general are this high--as Drosophila data argue. Unfortunately, although molecular and evolutionary studies can give information on the total mutation rate, they cannot determine what fraction are deleterious. In addition, there are short discussions of the advantages of diploidy, anisogamy, and separate sexes.},

abstract = {Ribosomal DNA sequence data abounds from numerous studies on the dinoflagellate endosymbionts of corals, and yet the multi-copy nature and intragenomic variability of rRNA genes and spacers confound interpretations of symbiont diversity and ecology. Making consistent sense of extensive sequence variation in a meaningful ecological and evolutionary context would benefit from the application of additional genetic markers. Sequences of the non-coding region of the plastid psbA minicircle (psbA(ncr)) were used to independently examine symbiont genotypic and species diversity found within and between colonies of Hawaiian reef corals in the genus Montipora. A single psbA(ncr) haplotype was recovered in most samples through direct sequencing ({\~{}}80-90{\%}) and members of the same internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2) type were phylogenetically differentiated from other ITS2 types by substantial psbA(ncr) sequence divergence. The repeated sequencing of bacterially-cloned fragments of psbA(ncr) from samples and clonal cultures often recovered a single numerically common haplotype accompanied by rare, highly-similar, sequence variants. When sequence artifacts of cloning and intragenomic variation are factored out, these data indicate that most colonies harbored one dominant Symbiodinium genotype. The cloning and sequencing of ITS2 DNA amplified from these same samples recovered numerically abundant variants (that are diagnostic of distinct Symbiodinium lineages), but also generated a large amount of sequences comprising PCR/cloning artifacts combined with ancestral and/or rare variants that, if incorporated into phylogenetic reconstructions, confound how small sequence differences are interpreted. Finally, psbA(ncr) sequence data from a broad sampling of Symbiodinium diversity obtained from various corals throughout the Indo-Pacific were concordant with ITS lineage membership (defined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis screening), yet exhibited substantially greater sequence divergence and revealed strong phylogeographic structure corresponding to major biogeographic provinces. The detailed genetic resolution provided by psbA(ncr) data brings further clarity to the ecology, evolution, and systematics of symbiotic dinoflagellates.},

abstract = {A multiple sequence alignment program, MAFFT, has been developed. The CPU time is drastically reduced as compared with existing methods. MAFFT includes two novel techniques. (i) Homo logous regions are rapidly identified by the fast Fourier transform (FFT), in which an amino acid sequence is converted to a sequence composed of volume and polarity values of each amino acid residue. (ii) We propose a simplified scoring system that performs well for reducing CPU time and increasing the accuracy of alignments even for sequences having large insertions or extensions as well as distantly related sequences of similar length. Two different heuristics, the progressive method (FFT-NS-2) and the iterative refinement method (FFT-NS-i), are implemented in MAFFT. The performances of FFT-NS-2 and FFT-NS-i were compared with other methods by computer simulations and benchmark tests; the CPU time of FFT-NS-2 is drastically reduced as compared with CLUSTALW with comparable accuracy. FFT-NS-i is over 100 times faster than T-COFFEE, when the number of input sequences exceeds 60, without sacrificing the accuracy.},

Melissopalynology, the identifi cation of pollen collected by bees, has proven to be an indispensable tool in fi elds such as pollination biology (Kearns and Inouye, 1993 ; Cusser and Goodell, 2013), pollinator foraging behavior (Louveaux, 1959 ; Wilson et al., 2010 ; Baum et al., 2011), sourcing and authenti-cation of apicultural products (Louveaux et al., 1978 ; Jones and Bryant, 1992 ; Dimou et al., 2007), and honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) nutritional biology (Severson and Parry, 1981 ; Forcone et al., 2011 ; Girard et al., 2012). The lattermost has taken on particular urgency in recent years due to alarming and largely unexplained regional declines in honey bee populations (vanEngelsdorp et al., 2009). Pollen is the main source of amino acids, lipids, sterols, vitamins, and minerals in the honey bee diet (Winston, 1987), and malnutrition, caused by the displacement of natu-ral fl oral communities by agricultural development, may con-tribute to recent patterns of honey bee decline (Naug, 2009 ; vanEngelsdorp and Meixner, 2010 ; Huang, 2012). Melissopaly-nology allows for direct observation of the honey bee pollen diet, providing a unique means for identifying nutritional defi -cits and informing potential efforts to improve foraging habitat. Traditional melissopalynology involves the careful prepara-tion of pollen samples for microscopic inspection followed by the identifi cation of individual pollen grains by comparison to a similarly prepared reference collection of pollen from local taxa (Erdtman, 1943 ; Kearns and Inouye, 1993). When pollen collected by honey bees is used, the steps above are normally preceded by the laborious sorting of bulk pollen samples into groups of pellets having similar color and texture (Dimou and Thrasyvoulou, 2007). To the extent that this sorting succeeds in discriminating true taxonomic groups, it provides a preliminary estimate of sample diversity and streamlines the process of mi-croscopic examination for large volumes of pollen. These meth-ods can provide reliable data when properly executed, but they suffer from being (1) highly dependent on human expertise and vulnerable to human error, (2) limited in taxonomic precision, as many taxa are only identifi able to family, and (3) prohibitively time-consuming for large-scale studies.

Genome size directly correlated with cell size, as documented previously for most eukaryotic cell lines. Among the smallest of dinoflagellates, Symbiodinium spp. (6–15 mm) possessed the lowest DNA content that we measured (1.5–4.8 pg . cell 1). Bloom-forming or potentially harmful species in the genera Alexandrium, Karenia, Pfiesteria, and Prorocentrum possessed genomes approximately 2 to 50 times larger in size. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that genome/cell size has apparently increased and decreased repeatedly during the evolution of dinoflagellates. In contrast, genome sizes were relatively consistent across distantly and closely related Symbiodinium spp. This may be the product of intracellular host habitats imposing strong selective pressures that have restricted symbiont size.

abstract = {The identification of diverse genetic types of symbiotic algae within the genus Symbiodinium was established over a decade ago. Since then the resolving power of the genetic identification used has increased to the point where multiple clades and sub-clades are now distinct. Observations of differences in susceptibility within and between coral species in regard to coral bleaching has been equally well documented over the last ten years. The role that different Symbiodinium types play in controlling bleaching susceptibility has gained much focus due to recent research indicating that certain Symbiodinium sub-clades often occur in symbiosis with bleaching tolerant corals. The aim of this thesis was to determine if physiological differences existed between various sub-clades of Symbiodinium and how they may explain the disparity in bleaching susceptibility seen in the field during bleaching events. This involved several experiments on both the intact host and isolated Symbiodinium of various reef building corals under experimental conditions. These varied from increased temperature to the addition of exogenous active oxygen species. The results of these studies suggested that Symbiodinium sub-clades show various physiological differences in both their tolerance to experimental conditions and the capacity of protective measures. The Symbiodinium sub-clades C3 and C15 showed differences in chlorophyll fluorescent measurements with distinct reductions in the dynamic yield of PSII, dark-adapted yield of PSII, relative electron transport rate and non-photochemical quenching at elevated temperatures for both freshly isolated Symbiodinium and for intact corals (in-hospite). Differences were also shown in the capacity of Symbiodinium types to use non-photochemical quenching, measured by chlorophyll fluorescence, and correlated with the size of the xanthophyll pool as well as its cycling, although appearing not to relate to temperature tolerance in this instance. Considerable differences were also found in light acclimation of different isolated Symbiodinium, while light acclimation did not differ significantly in-hospite. The effect of the addition of exogenous active oxygen species correlated with results obtained from experimental heating, suggesting that temperature tolerance to some extent was related to the capacity of Symbiodinium to deal with oxidative stress. From the results presented here it is hypothesised that perhaps damage to the thylakoid membrane occurred during both temperature and oxidative stress and that the observed differences in tolerance between C3 and C15 Symbiodinium sub-clades to both of these stress events could be explained by the disparity of thylakoid damage. Differences between Symbiodinium types may therefore explain the apparent variation in bleaching tolerance in some instances. Although this thesis proposes physiological differences between some Symbiodinium types, more research is needed to determine the full extent to which this controls bleaching susceptibility on a reef-wide scale. The outcomes of this thesis also indicate the considerable involvement that host variability plays in controlling bleaching susceptibility even amongst closely related coral species. Therefore, Symbiodinium type alone can not be used as the sole indicator of bleaching tolerance within reef building corals.},

Those authors whose models had finite-population effects found an advantage of recombination, and those whose models had infinite populations found none. The advantage of recombi- nation is that it breaks dowii random linkage disequilibrium generated by genetic drift. HILL and ROBERTSON found that the average effect 06 this ran- domly-generated linkage disequilibrium was to cause linked loci to interfere with each other's response to selection, even where there was no gene inter- action between the loci. This effect is shown to be identical to the original argument of FISHER and MULLER. It also predicts the “ratchet mechanism” discovered by MULLER, who pointed out that deleterious mutants would more readily increase in a population without recombination. Computer simulations of substitution of favcrable mutants and of the long-term increase of deleterious mutants verified the essential correctness of the ariginal FISHER-MULLER argument and the reality of the MULLER ratchet mechanism. It is argued that thesc constitute an ilitrinsic advantage of recombination capable of accounting for its persistence in the face of selection for tighter linkage between interacting polymorphisms, and possibly capabl3 of accounting for its origin.

Concordant phylogenetic and population genetic evidence clearly differentiate separately evolving, reproductively isolated lineages. We describe Symbiodinium boreum sp. nov. and S. eurythalpos sp. nov., two symbionts known to occur in colonies of the zebra coral, Oulastrea crispata (Scleractinia), which lives in turbid, marginal habitats extending from equatorial Southeast Asia to the main islands of Japan in the temperate northwest Pacific Ocean. Symbiodinium boreum was associated with O. crispata in temperate latitudes and S. eurythalpos was common to colonies in the tropics. The geographical ranges of both symbiont species overlapped in the subtropics where they sometimes co-occurred in the same host colony. Symbiodinium trenchii sp. nov. is also described. As a host-generalist symbiont, it often occurs in symbiosis with various species of Scleractinia possessing open (horizontal) modes of symbiont acquisition and is common to reef coral communities thriving in warm turbid reef habitats in the western Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Arabian/Persian Gulf, Red Sea and western Atlantic (Caribbean). As is typical for dinoflagellates, S. boreum and S. eurythalpos were haploid, but microsatellite loci from field-collected and cultured S. trenchii often possessed two alleles, implying that a genome-wide duplication occurred during the evolution of this species. The recognition that Clade D Symbiodinium contains species exhibiting marked differences in host specificity and geographical distribution will yield greater scientific clarity about how stress-tolerant symbionts function in the ecological response of coral–dinoflagellate symbioses to global climate change.},

abstract = {Multiple sequence alignments are fundamental to many sequence analysis methods. Most alignments are computed using the progressive alignment heuristic. These methods are starting to become a bottleneck in some analysis pipelines when faced with data sets of the size of many thousands of sequences. Some methods allow computation of larger data sets while sacrificing quality, and others produce high-quality alignments, but scale badly with the number of sequences. In this paper, we describe a new program called Clustal Omega, which can align virtually any number of protein sequences quickly and that delivers accurate alignments. The accuracy of the package on smaller test cases is similar to that of the high-quality aligners. On larger data sets, Clustal Omega outperforms other packages in terms of execution time and quality. Clustal Omega also has powerful features for adding sequences to and exploiting information in existing alignments, making use of the vast amount of precomputed information in public databases like Pfam.},

abstract = {Some invertebrates have enlisted autotrophic unicellular algae to provide a competitive metabolic advantage in nutritionally demanding habitats. These symbioses exist primarily but not exclusively in shallow tropical oceanic waters where clear water and low nutrient levels provide maximal advantage to the association. Mostly, the endosymbiotic algae are localized in host cells surrounded by a host-derived membrane (symbiosome). This anatomy has required adaptation of the host biochemistry to allow transport of the normally excreted inorganic nutrients (CO2, NH3 and PO43−) to the alga. In return, the symbiont supplies photosynthetic products to the host to meet its energy demands. Most attention has focused on the metabolism of CO2 and nitrogen sources. Carbon-concentrating mechanisms are a feature of all algae, but the products exported to the host following photosynthetic CO2 fixation vary. Identification of the stimulus for release of algal photosynthate in hospite remains elusive. Nitrogen assimilation within the symbiosis is an essential element in the host's control over the alga. Recent studies have concentrated on cnidarians because of the impact of global climate change resulting in coral bleaching. The loss of the algal symbiont and its metabolic contribution to the host has the potential to result in the transition from a coral-dominated to an algal-dominated ecosystem.},

abstract = {During the past decade, acute and chronic bleaching of tropical reef corals has occurred with increasing frequency and scale. Bleaching, i.e., the loss of pigment and the decrease in population density of symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae), is often correlated with an increase or decrease in sea surface temperature. Because little is known of the cellular events concomitant with thermal bleaching, we have investigated the mechanism of release of zooxanthellae by the tropical sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella and the reef coral Pocillopora damicornis in response to cold and heat stress. Both species released intact host endoderm cells containing zooxanthellae. The majority of the released host cells were viable, but they soon disintegrated in the seawater leaving behind isolated zooxanthellae. The detachment and release of intact host cells suggests that thermal stress causes host cell adhesion dysfunction in these cnidarians. Knowledge of the cellular entity released by the host during bleaching provides insight into both the underlying release mechanism and the way in which natural environmental stresses evoke a bleaching response.},

abstract = {Metabarcode surveys of DNA extracted from environmental samples are increasingly popular for biodiversity assessment in natural communities. Such surveys rely heavily on robust genetic markers. Therefore, analysis of PCR efficiency and subsequent biodiversity estimation for different types of genetic markers and their corresponding primers is important. Here, we test the PCR efficiency and biodiversity recovery potential of three commonly used genetic markers - nuclear small subunit ribosomal DNA (18S), mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S ribosomal RNA (mt16S) - using 454 pyrosequencing of a zooplankton community collected from Hamilton Harbour, Ontario. We found that biodiversity detection power and PCR efficiency varied widely among these markers. All tested primers for COI failed to provide high-quality PCR products for pyrosequencing, but newly designed primers for 18S and 16S passed all tests. Furthermore, multiple analyses based on large-scale pyrosequencing (i.e. 1/2 PicoTiter plate for each marker) showed that primers for 18S recover more (38 orders) groups than 16S (10 orders) across all taxa, and four vs. two orders and nine vs. six families for Crustacea. Our results showed that 18S, using newly designed primers, is an efficient and powerful tool for profiling biodiversity in largely unexplored communities, especially when amplification difficulties exist for mitochondrial markers such as COI. Universal primers for higher resolution markers such as COI are still needed to address the possible low resolution of 18S for species-level identification.},

abstract = {Dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium are among the most abundant and important group of eukaryotic microbes found in coral reef ecosystems. Recent analyses conducted on various host cnidarians indicated that Symbiodinium assemblages in the Caribbean Sea are genetically and ecologically diverse. In order to further characterize this diversity and identify processes important to its origins, samples from six orders of Cnidaria comprising 45 genera were collected from reef habitats around Barbados (eastern Caribbean) and from the Mesoamerican barrier reef off the coast of Belize (western Caribbean). Fingerprinting of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 identified 62 genetically different Symbiodinium. Additional analyses of clade B Symbiodinium using microsatellite flanker sequences unequivocally characterized divergent lineages, or "species," within what was previously thought to be a single entity (B1 or B184). In contrast to the Indo-Pacific where host-generalist symbionts dominate many coral communities, partner specificity in the Caribbean is relatively high and is influenced little by the host's apparent mode of symbiont acquisition. Habitat depth (ambient light) and geographic isolation appeared to influence the bathymetric zonation and regional distribution for most of the Symbiodinium spp. characterized. Approximately 80{\%} of Symbiodinium types were endemic to either the eastern or western Caribbean and 40-50{\%} were distributed to compatible hosts living in shallow, high-irradiance, or deep, low-irradiance environments. These ecologic, geographic, and phylogenetic patterns indicate that most of the present Symbiodinium diversity probably originated from adaptive radiations driven by ecological specialization in separate Caribbean regions during the Pliocene and Pleistocene periods.},

abstract = {Hybridization and interspecific recombination result in the formation of novel morphologies and associations of molecular markers. Thus, in the past, the existence of hybridization and introgression has been inferred by identifying individuals exhibiting some defined hybrid or backcross phenotypes or genotypes. This approach can be unreliable because it may under- or overestimate the frequency of different classes of individuals in a hybridized population. Also, this method provides no formal framework for testing a null hypothesis that the frequency of a particular class of hybrids or introgressants is equal to zero.A model is presented which uses the method of maximum likelihood and codominant molecular markers segregating for parental species specific alleles to estimate the frequencies of six classes of individuals that may occur in a hybridized population. Estimates of the frequency of parental species, hybrid, and introgressed individuals are unbiased if model assumptions are met. If model assumptions are violated, estimates of the frequency of introgression are conservative. Monte Carlo computer simulations are used to examine the bias and variance of the model estimates and to evaluate the effects of different sampling strategies as the number of loci with unique alleles, the frequencies of these alleles, and the number of putative hybrid individuals sampled are varied. Simulations were also used to examine the accuracy of delta and bootstrap methods of obtaining true variances of the model estimates. This approach provides evolutionary geneticists with a simple method to quantify the occurrence and extent of hybridization and introgression in natural populations.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Without further observation of hybridization, the question of such a phenomenon being widespread in Anthozoa remains. Here we have examined the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) and the nuclear internal transcribed spacer of ribosomal DNA (ITS-rDNA) from three species of the mass-spawning, encrusting anemone genus Zoanthus (Z. sansibaricus, Z. kuroshio, Z. gigantus) to investigate possible hybridization. The three species coexist at two of three sampling locations in southern Japan. Zoanthus spp. ITS-rDNA region spacers (ITS-1 and ITS-2) were shown to have very high rates of divergence. At locations where all three species co-existed, several of our sampled Z. sansibaricus individuals (with identical "sansi" COI sequences) possessed two very divergent (i.e., species-level difference) ITS-rDNA alleles, the expected "sansi" allele and the divergent "B" allele. Additionally, two Z. sansibaricus individuals possessed only "B" alleles despite having "sansi" COI sequences. These results indicate that Z. sansibaricus has possibly experienced interspecific hybridization at least once with a Zoanthus partner possessing the "B" allele, and that these resulting hybrids may also sexually reproduce, demonstrating potential hybridization occurring in the order Zoantharia (Hexacorallia).},

We examined these factors by surveying corals along a latitudinal gradient in Western Australia on reefs connected north to south by the warm-water Leeuwin Current. We used the internal transcribed spacer-2 (ITS-2) region of ribosomal DNA to characterize Symbiodinium communities in 19 species of reef coral (in 16 genera) from tropical Dampier (20.5 degrees S) to temperate Dunsborough (33.5 degrees S). We documented a high number of novel ITS-2 types in Symbiodinium clades B (1 type) and C (14 types) as well as 7 previously reported ITS-2 types in clades B, C, and D. In addition, we compared symbiont distributions with Giovanni's OBIG MODIS-Aqua satellite temperature data set and found that the putatively thermotolerant Symbiodinium ITS-2 type D1a was more frequently detected in 'chronically warm' tropical sites than at 'chronically cool' temperate sites, while clade B symbiont types showed the reverse pattern, being found in certain corals at the southernmost sites. Symbiodinium type D1a was generally most abundant at Dampier, where bleaching had occurred 1 mo prior to sampling, although some variation by host taxa was observed. The diverse and novel Symbiodinium communities documented here may be a result of (1) the variable environmental histories of the study sites, (2) the apparent genetic divergence within this genus resulting from the relative isolation of Western Australian reefs, and/or (3) the frequent transport of symbionts (in hospite or free-living) from Indo-Malay reefs to Western Australia via the Leeuwin Current. These results indicate that understudied reefs in remote and isolated areas may contain Symbiodinium diversity that has not been reported previously.},

abstract = {One of the principle ways in which reef building corals are likely to cope with a warmer climate is by changing to more thermally tolerant endosymbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) genotypes. It is highly likely that hosting a more heat-tolerant algal genotype will be accompanied by tradeoffs in the physiology of the coral. To better understand one of these tradeoffs, growth was investigated in the Indo-Pacific reef-building coral Acropora millepora in both the laboratory and the field. In the Keppel Islands in the southern Great Barrier Reef this species naturally harbors nrDNA ITS1 thermally sensitive type C2 or thermally tolerant type D zooxanthellae of the genus Symbiodinium and can change dominant type following bleaching. We show that under controlled conditions, corals with type D symbionts grow 29{\%} slower than those with type C2 symbionts. In the field, type D colonies grew 38{\%} slower than C2 colonies. These results demonstrate the magnitude of trade-offs likely to be experienced by this species as they acclimatize to warmer conditions by changing to more thermally tolerant type D zooxanthellae. Irrespective of symbiont genotype, corals were affected to an even greater degree by the stress of a bleaching event which reduced growth by more than 50{\%} for up to 18 months compared to pre-bleaching rates. The processes of symbiont change and acute thermal stress are likely to act in concert on coral growth as reefs acclimatize to more stressful warmer conditions, further compromising their regeneration capacity following climate change.},

abstract = {Loss of sexual reproduction is considered an evolutionary dead end for metazoans, but bdelloid rotifers challenge this view as they appear to have persisted asexually for millions of years. Neither male sex organs nor meiosis have ever been observed in these microscopic animals: oocytes are formed through mitotic divisions, with no reduction of chromosome number and no indication of chromosome pairing. However, current evidence does not exclude that they may engage in sex on rare, cryptic occasions. Here we report the genome of a bdelloid rotifer, Adineta vaga (Davis, 1873), and show that its structure is incompatible with conventional meiosis. At gene scale, the genome of A. vaga is tetraploid and comprises both anciently duplicated segments and less divergent allelic regions. However, in contrast to sexual species, the allelic regions are rearranged and sometimes even found on the same chromosome. Such structure does not allow meiotic pairing; instead, we find abundant evidence of gene conversion, which may limit the accumulation of deleterious mutations in the absence of meiosis. Gene families involved in resistance to oxidation, carbohydrate metabolism and defence against transposons are significantly expanded, which may explain why transposable elements cover only 3{\%} of the assembled sequence. Furthermore, 8{\%} of the genes are likely to be of non-metazoan origin and were probably acquired horizontally. This apparent convergence between bdelloids and prokaryotes sheds new light on the evolutionary significance of sex.},

abstract = {The response of chlorophyll-protein complexes to super- and sub-saturating photon-flux densities, PFD (250 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1) and 40 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1), respectively) were analyzed for Symbiodinium microadriaticum Freudenthal, the symbiont of the Caribbean jellyfish Cassiopeia xamachana; S. Kawagutii Trench and Blank, the symbiont of the Indo-Pacific scleractinian Montipora verrucosa; and S. Pilosum Trench and Blank, the symbiont of the Carribbean zoanthid Zoanthus sociatus. The results indicate that each species exhibits a quantitatively distinct chlorophyll (chi) a distribution among its chl-protein complexes when cultured under standardized high and low light conditions. In response to sub-saturating PFD, the three species differentially increased the cellular concentrations of most of the chl-protein complexes. Increases in P-700 (reaction center of Photosystem I) under sub-saturating PFD correlate with an increase in the cellular concentrations of the Photosystem I-enriched complexes. Similarly, increases in photosynthetic unit (PSU) size correlate with an increase in the cellular concentrations of the water-soluble peridinin-chl-a-protein (PCP) complexes and the membrane-bound chl a-chl c(2)-peridinin-protein (acpPC) complexes, which together represent the light-harvesting components of this group. In S. Microadriaticum, acclimation to sub-saturating PFD uniquely includes the preferential enrichment of the dimeric form of PCP. Under super-saturating PFD, an enrichment in photo-protective xanthophylls was detected in acpPC from S. Microadriaticum and S. Pilosum, but not from S. Kawagutii. Each species demonstrated a characteristic photo-acclimatory response which correlates with its distribution as endosymbiont in nature, supporting the concept that different species of symbiotic dinoflagellates are adapted (sensu Bjorkman 1981) to different photic environments. The study was conducted between May 1992 and November 1994.},

abstract = {Background Dinoflagellates are known for their capacity to form harmful blooms (e.g., "red tides") and as symbiotic, photosynthetic partners for corals. These unicellular eukaryotes have permanently condensed, liquid-crystalline chromosomes and immense nuclear genome sizes, often several times the size of the human genome. Here we describe the first draft assembly of a dinoflagellate nuclear genome, providing insights into its genome organization and gene inventory. Results Sequencing reads from Symbiodinium minutum were assembled into 616 Mbp gene-rich DNA regions that represented roughly half of the estimated 1,500 Mbp genome of this species. The assembly encoded ???42,000 protein-coding genes, consistent with previous dinoflagellate gene number estimates using transcriptomic data. The Symbiodinium genome contains duplicated genes for regulator of chromosome condensation proteins, nearly one-third of which have eukaryotic orthologs, whereas the remainder have most likely been acquired through bacterial horizontal gene transfers. Symbiodinium genes are enriched in spliceosomal introns (mean = 18.6 introns/gene). Donor and acceptor splice sites are unique, with 5??? sites utilizing not only GT but also GC and GA, whereas at 3??? sites, a conserved G is present after AG. All spliceosomal snRNA genes (U1-U6) are clustered in the genome. Surprisingly, the Symbiodinium genome displays unidirectionally aligned genes throughout the genome, forming a cluster-like gene arrangement. Conclusions We show here that a dinoflagellate genome exhibits unique and divergent characteristics when compared to those of other eukaryotes. Our data elucidate the organization and gene inventory of dinoflagellates and lay the foundation for future studies of this remarkable group of eukaryotes. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

DGGE revealed that E. quadricolor predominantly associated with six types of clade C (four of which are novel) and that most anemones harboured multiple types simultaneously. Anemones from southern locations associated with a mixed assemblage of C25 and a variant of C3. This assemblage also dominated the central location, but was absent at the northern location. At central and northern sites, two novel variants of C42(type2) and C1 were found. Anemones hosting C42(type2) also showed a low abundance of variants of C3 and C1, and E1 was found in one sample, as revealed by bacterial cloning. The occurrence of geographically distinct ITS2 types or a consortium of types might reflect a need to optimise physiological performance of the symbiosis at different latitudes.},

abstract = {Intra- and intercolony diversity and distribution of zooxanthellae in acroporid corals is largely uncharted. In this study, two molecular methods were applied to determine the distribution of zooxanthellae in the branching corals Acropora tenuis and A. valida at several reef locations in the central section of the Great Barrier Reef. Sun-exposed and shaded parts of all colonies were examined. Single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis showed that individual colonies of A. tenuis at two locations harbour two strains of Symbiodinium belonging to clade C (C1 and C2), whereas conspecific colonies at two other reefs harboured a single zooxanthella strain. A. valida was found to simultaneously harbour strains belonging to two distinct phylogenetic clades (C and D) at all locations sampled. A novel method with improved sensitivity (quantitative polymerase chain reaction using Taqman fluorogenic probes) was used to map the relative abundance distribution of the two zooxanthella clades. At two of the five sampling locations both coral species were collected. At these two locations, composition of the zooxanthella communities showed the same pattern in both coral species, i.e. correlation with ambient light in Pioneer Bay and an absence thereof in Nelly Bay. The results show that the distribution of genetically distinct zooxanthellae is correlated with light regime and possibly temperature in some (but not all) colonies of A. tenuis and A. valida and at some reef locations, which we interpret as acclimation to local environmental conditions.},

abstract = {The ribosomal DNA's of Xenopus laevis and Xenopus mulleri differ in their nucleotide sequences. Their base compositions are 67 and 65{\%} G + C, respectively. The nucleotide sequences which code for 28 s and 18 s ribosomal RNA in the rDNA of the two species could not be distinguished by their size, base composition, or fidelity of hybridization. The difference between the two ribosomal DNA's lies in their spacer regions. Complementary RNA transcribed from spacer regions hybridized to heterologous rDNA at less than 20{\%} of the level with which it hybridized to homologous rDNA. Partly denatured molecules of the two rDNA's were further compared by “denaturation mapping” in the electron microscope. The repeat length in X. mulleri rDNA is about the same as that in X. laevis rDNA. While the regions presumed to code for the 40 s precursor of rRNA have very similar denaturation patterns in the ribosomal DNA of X. laevis and X. mulleri, the patterns in the spacer regions are very different. Both physico-chemical and electron microscopic analyses show that the repeating sequences in X. mulleri ribosomal DNA are very similar, if not identical, to each other with respect to size and nucleotide sequence, a fact previously demonstrated for the rDNA of X. laevis. The multiple spacer sequences interspersed between the 18 s and 28 s gene regions have evolved together; the 18 s and 28 s genes have remained unchanged. Although the spacer regions differ greatly between species, they are very similar if not identical within each species. We conclude that a “correction” mechanism must operate to spread a mutation in one spacer sequence to the neighboring spacers faster than new changes arise in these genes. This phenomenon, which occurs within a single organism, is referred to as “horizontal” evolution, in contrast to “vertical” evolution which is the spread of a mutation through a breeding population.},

abstract = {Symbiotic dinoflagellates belonging to the genus Symbiodinium (Freudenthal) are found worldwide in association with shallow-water tropical and subtropical marine invertebrates. Most phylogenetic studies of Symbiodinium have used nuclear rRNA (nrDNA) genes to infer relationships among members of the genus. In this report, we present the first phylogeny of Symbiodinium based on DNA sequences from a mitochondrial protein-coding gene (cytochrome oxidase subunit I [cox1]). Two principal groups, one comprised of Symbiodinium clade A and the second encompassing Symbiodinium clades B/C/D/E/F, are strongly supported in the cox1 phylogeny. Relationships within Symbiodinium clades B/C/D/E/F, however, are less well resolved compared with phylogenies inferred from nrDNA and chloroplast large subunit (cp23S)-rDNA genes. Statistical tests between alternative tree topologies verified, with an exception being the position of one controversial member of Symbiodinium clade D, that relationships inferred fromcox1 are congruent with those inferred from nrDNA and cp23S-rDNA. Taken together, the relationships between the major Symbiodinium clades are robust, and there appears to be no evidence of hybridization or differential introgression of nuclear and plastid genomes between clades.},

abstract = {For evolutionary comparisons, phylogenetics and evaluation of potential interbreeding taxa of a species, various loci have served for animals and plants and protistans. One [second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA] is highly suitable for all. Its sequence is species specific. It has already been used extensively and very successfully for plants and some protistans, and a few animals (where historically, the mitochondrial genes have dominated species studies). Despite initial impressions that ITS2 is too variable, it has proven to provide useful biological information at higher taxonomic levels, even across all eukaryotes, thanks to the conserved aspects of its transcript secondary structure. The review of all eukaryote groups reveals that ITS2 is expandable, but always retains in its RNA transcript a common core structure of two helices with hallmark characteristics important for ribosomal RNA processing. This aspect of its RNA transcript secondary structure can rescue difficult alignment problems, making the ITS2 a more powerful tool for phylogenetics. Equally important, the recognition of eukaryote-wide homology regions provides extensive and detailed information to test experimental studies of ribosomal rRNA processing.},

Two strains of P. triestinum, previously adapted to grow under standard conditions (f/2 medium, 20 degrees C), were grown under increased nutrient concentrations and temperature (f medium, 25 degrees C) until fitness and cell size were invariant as a function of time (720 days, corresponding to c. 400 generations). The mean value for fitness of both strains of P. triestinum showed a significant increase whereas a decrease in mean cell size was found. The changes in fitness have adaptive value, but the changes in cell size were due to both adaptation and the contribution of chance-plus-history.},

Zooxanthellae density and pigment contents monitored throughout the 18 mo sampling period indicated that no significant bleaching occurred in A. palifera. Molecular phylo- typing showed that 2 distinct symbionts, Phylotypes C and D, were associated with A. palifera, either individually or simultaneously. Population surveys throughout the bimonthly sampling period dem- onstrated that the symbiont community within A. palifera was highly dynamic with significant fluctu- ations; a drop in the Phylotype D percentage occurred in May, which was correlated with a rise in seawater temperature in the late spring/early summer at the sampled reef. Direct tracking of tagged corals provided evidence that seasonal fluctuations in the algal symbiont communities not only involve changes in zooxanthellae densities and pigment contents, but also a reshuffling of different Symbiodinium phylotypes. Our study highlights that stress tolerance among phylotypes urgently needs to be re-evaluated through a better understanding of the physiological traits of symbionts.},

Here we show that after bleaching, the adult octocoral Briareum sp. acquire dinoflagellate symbionts (Symbiodinium sp.) from the environment. Uptake of exogenous symbionts provides a mechanism for response to changes in the environment and resilience in the symbiosis.},

abstract = {The fine structure of the symbiotic dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium has been well described. All of the published descriptions are based on tissue that was fixed in standard aldehyde and osmium fixatives and dehydrated in an ethanol series before embedding. When the technique of freeze-substitution was used to fix tissue from Cassiopeia xamachana, Aiptasia pallida, and Phyllactis flosculifera and prepare it for embedding, thecal vesicles were revealed within the in situ symbionts of all three species. Although these structures have been identified in cultured symbionts, they have never been described in the in situ symbionts. A review of the literature has revealed several instances where thecal vesicles were either overlooked or identified incorrectly. Thus the formal description of the genus Symbiodinium, which describes the in situ symbionts, contains information that is based on artifact and should be revised. A revision of the genus is suggested, and the true nature of these structures and their significance in the symbiotic association are discussed.},

abstract = {Shallow water anthozoans, the major builders of modern coral reefs, enhance their metabolic and calcification rates with algal symbionts. Controversy exists over whether these anthozoan-algae associations are flexible over the lifetimes of individual hosts, promoting acclimative plasticity, or are closely linked, such that hosts and symbionts co-evolve across generations. Given the diversity of algal symbionts and the morphological plasticity of many host species, cryptic variation within either partner could potentially confound studies of anthozoan-algal associations. Here, we used ribosomal, organelle and nuclear sequences, along with microsatellite variation, to study the relationship between lineages of a common Caribbean gorgonian and its algal symbionts. The gorgonian Eunicea flexuosa is a broadcast spawner, composed of two recently diverged, genetically distinct lineages largely segregated by depth. We sampled colonies of the two lineages across depth gradients at three Caribbean locations. We find that each host lineage is associated with a unique Symbiodinium B1/184 phylotype. This relationship between host and symbiont is maintained when host colonies are reciprocally transplanted, although cases of within phylotype switching were also observed. Even when the phylotypes of both partners are present at intermediate depths, the specificity between host and symbiont lineages remained absolute. Unrecognized cryptic diversity may mask host-symbiont specificity and change the inference of evolutionary processes in mutualistic associations. Symbiotic specificity thus likely contributes to the ecological divergence of the two partners, generating species diversity within coral reefs.},

Sparse data indicate that Symbiodinium populations show limited spatial connectivity; however, no studies have investigated temporal dynamics for in hospite Symbiodinium populations following significant mortality and recruitment events in coral populations. We investigated the combined influences of spatial isolation and disturbance on the population dynamics of the generalist Symbiodinium type C2 (ITS1 rDNA) hosted by the scleractinian coral Acropora millepora in the central Great Barrier Reef. Using eight microsatellite markers, we genotyped Symbiodinium in a total of 401 coral colonies, which were sampled from seven sites across a 12-year period including during flood plume-induced coral bleaching. Genetic differentiation of Symbiodinium was greatest within sites, explaining 70-86{\%} of the total genetic variation. An additional 9-27{\%} of variation was explained by significant differentiation of populations among sites separated by 0.4-13 km, which is consistent with low levels of dispersal via water movement and historical disturbance regimes. Sampling year accounted for 6-7{\%} of total genetic variation and was related to significant coral mortality following severe bleaching in 1998 and a cyclone in 2006. Only 3{\%} of the total genetic variation was related to coral bleaching status, reflecting generally small (8{\%}) reductions in allelic diversity within bleached corals. This reduction probably reflected a loss of genotypes in hospite during bleaching, although no site-wide changes in genetic diversity were observed. Combined, our results indicate the importance of disturbance regimes acting together with limited oceanographic transport to determine the genetic composition of Symbiodinium types within reefs.},

abstract = {To examine algal (= zooxanthellae) regulation and control, and the factors determining algal densities in hard corals, the zooxanthellae mitotic index and release rates were regularly determined in branch tips from a colony of a staghorn coral, Acropora formosa, recovering from a coral 'bleaching' event (the stress-related dissociation of the coral–algal symbiosis). Mathematical models based upon density-dependent decreases in the algal division frequency and increases in algal release rates during the post-bleaching recovery period accurately predict the observed recovery period (ca. 20 weeks). The models suggest that (i) the colony recovered its algal population from the division of the remaining zooxanthellae, and (ii) the continual loss of zooxanthellae significantly slowed the recovery of the coral. Possible reasons for the 'paradoxical' loss of healthy zooxanthellae from the bleached coral are discussed in terms of endodermal processes occurring in the recovering coral and the redistribution of newly formed zooxanthellae to aposymbiotic host cells. At a steady-state algal density of 2.1 x 106 zooxanthellae cm-2 at the end of the recovery period, the zooxanthellae would have to form a double layer of cells in the coral tissues, consistent with microscopic observations. Neighbouring colonies of A. formosa with inherently higher algal densities possess proportionately smaller zooxanthellae. Results suggest that space availability and the size of the algal symbionts determines the algal densities in the coral colonies. The large increases in the algal densities reported in corals exposed to elevated nutrient concentrations (i.e between a two- and five-fold increase in the algal standing stock) are not consistent with this theory. We suggest that increases of this magnitude are a product of the experimental conditions: reasons for this statement are discussed. We propose that the stability of the coral–algal symbiosis under non-stress conditions, and the constancy of zooxanthellae densities in corals reported across growth form, depth and geographic range, are related to space availability limiting algal densities. However, at these densities, zooxanthellae have attributes consistent with nutrient limitation.},

abstract = {It is speculated that the function of the replication fork barrier (RFB) site is to avoid collision between the 35S rDNA transcription machinery and the DNA replication fork, because the RFB site is located near the 3'-end of the gene and inhibits progression of the replication fork moving in the opposite direction to the transcription machinery. However, the collision has never been observed in a blockless (fob1) mutant with 150 copies of rDNA. The gene FOB1 was shown previously to be required for replication fork blocking activity at the RFB site, and also for the rDNA copy number variation through unequal sister-chromatid recombination. This study documents the detection of fork collision in an fob1 derivative with reduced rDNA copy number (approximately 20) using two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis. This suggests that most of these reduced copies are actively transcribed. The collision was dependent on the transcription by RNA polymerase I. In addition, the transcription stimulated rDNA copy number variation, and the production of the extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs), whose accumulation is thought to be a cause of aging. These results suggest that such a transcription-dependent fork collision induces recombination, and may function as a general recombination trigger for multiplication of highly transcribed single-copy genes.},

It is thought that functional diversity within Symbiodinium may allow some corals to rapidly adapt to different environments by changing the type of Symbiodinium with which they partner; however, very little is known about the molecular basis of the functional differences among symbiont groups. One group of Symbiodinium that is hypothesized to be important for the future of reefs is clade D, which, in general, seems to provide the coral holobiont (i.e., coral host and associated symbiont community) with elevated thermal tolerance. Using high-throughput sequencing data from field-collected corals we assembled, de novo, draft transcriptomes for Symbiodinium clades C and D. We then explore the functional basis of thermal tolerance in clade D by comparing rates of coding sequence evolution among the four clades of Symbiodinium most commonly found in reef-building corals (A-D).},

However, in peridinin dinoflagellates, an ecologically important group of unicellular algae, the chloroplast genome is fragmented into plasmid-like 'minicircles', each of 2-3kb. Furthermore, the chloroplast gene content of dinoflagellates is dramatically reduced. Only 14 genes have been found on dinoflagellate minicircles, and recent evidence from EST studies suggests that most of the genes typically located in the chloroplast in other algae and plants are located in the nucleus. In this study, Southern blot analysis was used to estimate the copy number per cell of a variety of minicircles during different growth stages in the dinoflagellate Amphidinium operculatum. It was found that minicircle copy number is low during the exponential growth stage but increases during the later growth phase to resemble the situation seen in other plants and algae.

abstract = {Reef corals form associations with an array of genetically and physiologically distinct endosymbionts from the genus Symbiodinium. Some corals harbor different clades of symbionts simultaneously, and over time the relative abundances of these clades may change through a process called symbiont shuffling. It is hypothesized that this process provides a mechanism for corals to respond to environmental threats such as global warming. However, only a minority of coral species have been found to harbor more than one symbiont clade simultaneously and the current view is that the potential for symbiont shuffling is limited. Using a newly developed real-time PCR assay, this paper demonstrates that previous studies have underestimated the presence of background symbionts because of the low sensitivity of the techniques used. The assay used here targets the multi-copy rDNA ITS1 region and is able to detect Symbiodinium clades C and D with {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} 100-fold higher sensitivity compared to conventional techniques. Technical considerations relating to intragenomic variation, estimating copy number and non-symbiotic contamination are discussed. Eighty-two colonies from four common scleractinian species (Acropora millepora, Acropora tenuis, Stylophora pistillata and Turbinaria reniformis) and 11 locations on the Great Barrier Reef were tested for background Symbiodinium clades. Although these colonies had been previously identified as harboring only a single clade based on SSCP analyses, background clades were detected in 78{\{}{\%}{\}} of the samples, indicating that the potential for symbiont shuffling may be much larger than currently thought.},

abstract = {The mutualistic symbioses between reef-building corals and micro-algae form the basis of coral reef ecosystems, yet recent environmental changes threaten their survival. Diversity in host-symbiont pairings on the sub-species level could be an unrecognized source of functional variation in response to stress. The Caribbean elkhorn coral, Acropora palmata, associates predominantly with one symbiont species (Symbiodinium 'fitti'), facilitating investigations of individual-level (genotype) interactions. Individual genotypes of both host and symbiont were resolved across the entire species' range. Most colonies of a particular animal genotype were dominated by one symbiont genotype (or strain) that may persist in the host for decades or more. While Symbiodinium are primarily clonal, the occurrence of recombinant genotypes indicates sexual recombination is the source of this genetic variation, and some evidence suggests this happens within the host. When these data are examined at spatial scales spanning the entire distribution of A. palmata, gene flow among animal populations was an order of magnitude greater than among populations of the symbiont. This suggests that independent micro-evolutionary processes created dissimilar population genetic structures between host and symbiont. The lower effective dispersal exhibited by the dinoflagellate raises questions regarding the extent to which populations of host and symbiont can co-evolve during times of rapid and substantial climate change. However, these findings also support a growing body of evidence, suggesting that genotype-by-genotype interactions may provide significant physiological variation, influencing the adaptive potential of symbiotic reef corals to severe selection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Different high-dimensional regression methodologies exist for the selection of variables to predict a continuous variable. To improve the variable selection in case clustered observations are present in the training data, an extension towards mixed-effects modeling (MM) is requested, but may not always be straightforward to implement.In this article, we developed such a MM extension (GA-MM-MMI) for the automated variable selection by a linear regression based genetic algorithm (GA) using multi-model inference (MMI). We exemplify our approach by training a linear regression model for prediction of resistance to the integrase inhibitor Raltegravir (RAL) on a genotype-phenotype database, with many integrase mutations as candidate covariates. The genotype-phenotype pairs in this database were derived from a limited number of subjects, with presence of multiple data points from the same subject, and with an intra-class correlation of 0.92.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In generation of the RAL model, we took computational efficiency into account by optimizing the GA parameters one by one, and by using tournament selection. To derive the main GA parameters we used 3 times 5-fold cross-validation. The number of integrase mutations to be used as covariates in the mixed effects models was 25 (chrom.size). A GA solution was found when R2MM {\textgreater} 0.95 (goal.fitness). We tested three different MMI approaches to combine the results of 100 GA solutions into one GA-MM-MMI model. When evaluating the GA-MM-MMI performance on two unseen data sets, a more parsimonious and interpretable model was found (GA-MM-MMI TOP18: mixed-effects model containing the 18 most prevalent mutations in the GA solutions, refitted on the training data) with better predictive accuracy (R2) in comparison to GA-ordinary least squares (GA-OLS) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated improved performance when using GA-MM-MMI for selection of mutations on a genotype-phenotype data set. As we largely automated setting the GA parameters, the method should be applicable on similar datasets with clustered observations.},

abstract = {Over the past 20 yr much has been learned about a unique symbiotic interaction between fungal endophytes and grasses. The fungi (Clavicipitaceae, Ascomycota) grow intercellularly and systemically in aboveground plant parts. Vertically transmitted asexual endophytes forming asymptomatic infections of cool-season grasses have been repeatedly derived from sexual species that abort host inflorescences. The phylogenetic distribution of seed-transmitted endophytes is strongly suggestive of cocladogenesis with their hosts. Molecular evidence indicates that many seed-transmitted endophytes are interspecific hybrids. Superinfection may result in hyphal fusion and parasexual recombination. Most endophytes produce one or more alkaloid classes that likely play some role in defending the host plant against pests. Hybridization may have led to the proliferation of alkaloid-production genes among asexual endophytes, favoring hybrids. The ergot alkaloid ergovaline, lolitrems, and lolines are produced by only a single sexual species, Epichlo{\"{e}} festucae, but they are common in seed-transmitted endophytes, suggesting that E. festucae contributed genes for their synthesis. Asexual hybrids may also be favored by the counteracting of the accumulation of deleterious mutations (Muller's rachet). Endophyte infection can provide other benefits, such as enhanced drought tolerance, photosynthetic rate, and growth. Estimates of infection frequency have revealed variable levels of infection with especially high prevalence in the subfamily Pooideae. Longitudinal studies suggest that the prevalence of seed-transmitted endophytes can increase rapidly over time. In field experiments, infected tall fescue suppressed other grasses and forbs relative to uninfected fescue and supported lower consumer populations. Unlike other widespread plant/microbial symbioses based on the acquisition of mineral resources, grass/endophyte associations are based primarily on protection of the host from biotic and abiotic stresses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Scleractinian corals are currently a focus of major interest because of their ecological importance and the uncertain fate of coral reefs in the face of increasing anthropogenic pressure. Despite this, remarkably little is known about the evolutionary origins of corals. The Scleractinia suddenly appear in the fossil record about 240 Ma, but the range of morphological variation seen in these Middle Triassic fossils is comparable to that of modern scleractinians, implying much earlier origins that have so far remained elusive. A significant weakness in reconstruction(s) of early coral evolution is that deep-sea corals have been poorly represented in molecular phylogenetic analyses.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS:By adding new data from a large and representative range of deep-water species to existing molecular datasets and applying a relaxed molecular clock, we show that two exclusively deep-sea families, the Gardineriidae and Micrabaciidae, diverged prior to the Complexa/Robusta coral split around 425 Ma, thereby pushing the evolutionary origin of scleractinian corals deep into the Paleozoic.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSIONS:The early divergence and distinctive morphologies of the extant gardineriid and micrabaciid corals suggest a link with Ordovician "scleractiniamorph" fossils that were previously assumed to represent extinct anthozoan skeletonized lineages. Therefore, scleractinian corals most likely evolved from Paleozoic soft-bodied ancestors. Modern shallow-water Scleractinia, which are dependent on symbionts, appear to have had several independent origins from solitary, non-symbiotic precursors. The Scleractinia have survived periods of massive climate change in the past, suggesting that as a lineage they may be less vulnerable to future changes than often assumed.},

Because zooxanthellae have traditionally been difficult to classify, little is known about the natural history of these symbioses. Zooxanthellae were isolated from 131 individuals in 22 host taxa and characterized by the use of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in nuclear genes that encode small ribosomal subunit RNA (ssRNA). Six algal RFLPs, distributed host species specifically, were detected. Individual hosts contained one algal RFLP. Zooxanthella phylogenetic relationships were estimated from 22 algal ssRNA sequences-one from each host species. Closely related algae were found in dissimilar hosts, suggesting that animal and algal lineages have maintained a flexible evolutionary relation with each other.},

abstract = {The metabolically versatile Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa inhabits terrestrial, aquatic, animal-, human-, and plant-host-associated environments and is an important causative agent of nosocomial infections, particularly in intensive-care units. The population genetics of P. aeruginosa was investigated by an approach that is generally applicable to the rapid, robust, and informative genotyping of bacteria. DNA, amplified from the bacterial colony by circles of multiplex primer extension, is hybridized onto a microarray to yield an electronically portable binary multimarker genotype that represents the core genome by single nucleotide polymorphisms and the accessory genome by markers of genomic islets and islands. The 240 typed P. aeruginosa strains of diverse habitats and geographic origin segregated into two large nonoverlapping clusters and 45 isolated clonal complexes with few or no partners. The majority of strains belonged to few dominant clones widespread in disease and environmental habitats. The most frequent genotype was represented by the sequenced strain PA14. Core and accessory genome were found to be nonrandomly assembled in P. aeruginosa. Individual clones preferred a specific repertoire of accessory segments. Even the most promiscuous genomic island, pKLC102, had integrated preferentially into a subset of clones. Moreover, some physically distant loci of the core genome, including oriC, showed nonrandom associations of genotypes, whereas other segments in between were freely recombining. Thus, the P. aeruginosa genome is made up of clone-typical segments in core and accessory genome and of blocks in the core with unrestricted gene flow in the population.},

abstract = {Coral bleaching, the loss of color due to loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae or their pigment, appears to be increasing in intensity and geographic extent, perhaps related to increasing sea surface temperatures. The adaptive bleaching hypothesis (ABH) posits that when environmental circumstances change, the loss of one or more kinds of zooxanthellae is rapidly, sometimes unnoticeably, followed by formation of a new symbiotic consortium with different zooxanthellae that are more suited to the new conditions in the host's habitat. Fundamental assumptions of the ABH include (1) different types of zooxanthellae respond differently to environmental conditions, specifically temperature, and (2) bleached adults can secondarily acquire zooxanthellae from the environment. We present simple tests of these assumptions and show that (1) genetically different strains of zooxanthellae exhibit different responses to elevated temperature, (2) bleached adult hosts can acquire algal symbionts with an apparently dose-dependent relationship between the concentration of zooxanthellae and the rate of establishment of the symbiosis, (3) and finally, bleached adult hosts can acquire symbionts from the water column.},

abstract = {Genetic mapping methods provide a unique opportunity to study the interactions of differentiated genes and genomes in a hybrid genetic background. After a brief discussion of theoretical and analytical concerns, we review the application of these methods to a wide range of evolutionary issues. Map-based studies of experimental hybrids indicate that most postzygotic reproductive barriers in plants are polygenic and that the expression of extreme or novel traits in segregating hybrids (transgressive segregation) results from the complementary action of divergent parental alleles. However, genetic studies of hybrid vigor do not concur in their interpretations of the relative roles of dominance, overdominance, and epistasis. Map-based studies of natural hybrids are much rarer, but the few existing studies confirm the polygenic basis of postzygotic barriers and demonstrate the utility of genetic linkage for detecting cryptic introgression. In addition, studies of experimental and natural hybrid lineages provide compelling evidence that homoploid hybrid speciation has occurred in nature, and that it represents a rapid and repeatable mode of speciation. Data further indicate that this mode is facilitated by strong fertility selection and high chromosomal mutation rates. We recommend that future studies of hybrid genomes focus on natural hybrids, not only because of the paucity of data in this area, but also because of the availability of highly recombinant hybrid genotypes in hybrid zones. Of particular value will be studies of long-lived or difficult-to-propagate organisms, which previously have not been amenable to genetic study.},

The group admits that the two-locus barcode is far from perfect due to the low identification rate, and the search is not over. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we compared seven candidate DNA barcodes (psbA-trnH, matK, rbcL, rpoC1, ycf5, ITS2, and ITS) from medicinal plant species. Our ranking criteria included PCR amplification efficiency, differential intra- and inter-specific divergences, and the DNA barcoding gap. Our data suggest that the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) of nuclear ribosomal DNA represents the most suitable region for DNA barcoding applications. Furthermore, we tested the discrimination ability of ITS2 in more than 6600 plant samples belonging to 4800 species from 753 distinct genera and found that the rate of successful identification with the ITS2 was 92.7{\%} at the species level. CONCLUSIONS: The ITS2 region can be potentially used as a standard DNA barcode to identify medicinal plants and their closely related species. We also propose that ITS2 can serve as a novel universal barcode for the identification of a broader range of plant taxa.},

A key question is whether this is due to insufficient reductions in harvest rates or the erosion of population resilience. Using a global meta-analysis of overfished stocks, we find that resilience of those stocks subjected to moderate levels of overfishing is enhanced, not compromised, offering the possibility of swift recovery. However, prolonged intense overexploitation, especially for collapsed stocks, not only delays rebuilding but also substantially increases the uncertainty in recovery times, despite predictable influences of fishing and life history. Timely and decisive reductions in harvest rates could mitigate this uncertainty. Instead, current harvest and low biomass levels render recovery improbable for the majority of the world's depleted stocks.},

Many of these$\backslash$nvariants are only minimally divergent from one another (1 bp or less),$\backslash$nand others occupy basal nodes of traditional species phylogenies$\backslash$n({\{}''{\}}living ancestors{\{}''{\}}), indicating that some Symbiodinium$\backslash$nITS-2 diversity may represent intraspecific sequence variation. This$\backslash$nhypothesis was tested for Symbiodinium clades A-D (the dominant symbionts$\backslash$nof reef corals) through the construction of statistical parsimony$\backslash$nnetworks of ITS-2 sequence diversity, and identification of clusters$\backslash$nof closely related sequences within these networks. Initial assessments$\backslash$nindicated that ecological differentiation exists between, but not$\backslash$nwithin, these clusters. This approach, although imperfect in its$\backslash$nability to identify species boundaries in all cases, nevertheless$\backslash$ndramatically reduces ``species{\{}''{\}} diversity in Symbiodinium (from$\backslash$nsimilar to 175 to 35).

The role of temperature in coral bleaching has been extensively investigated and is widely accepted. A bleaching event was observed on the marginal high-latitude reefs of South Africa located at Sodwana Bay during the summer months of 2000.

The bleaching was limited to Two-mile Reef and Nine-mile Reef at Sodwana Bay and affected {\{}{\textless}{\}}12{\{}{\%}{\}} of the total living cover on Two-mile Reef. Montipora spp., Alveopora spongiosa and Acropora spp. were bleached, as well as some Alcyoniidae (Sinularia dura, Lobophytum depressum, L. patulum). A cyclical increase in sea temperature (with a period of 5-6 years) was recorded during 1998-2000 in addition to the regional temperature increase caused by the El Ni??o Southern Oscillation phenomenon. The mean sea temperature increased at a rate of 0.27??C year-1 from May 1994 to April 2000. High maximum temperatures were measured ({\{}{\textgreater}{\}}29??C). The lowest mean monthly and the mean maximum monthly temperatures at which coral bleaching occurred were 27.5 and 28.8??C, respectively, while the duration for which high temperatures occurred in 2000 was 67 days at ???27.5??C (4 days at ???28.8??C).

abstract = {Background: The most widely used multiple sequence alignment methods require sequences to be clustered as an initial step. Most sequence clustering methods require a full distance matrix to be computed between all pairs of sequences. This requires memory and time proportional to N 2 for N sequences. When N grows larger than 10,000 or so, this becomes increasingly prohibitive and can form a significant barrier to carrying out very large multiple alignments. Results: In this paper, we have tested variations on a class of embedding methods that have been designed for clustering large numbers of complex objects where the individual distance calculations are expensive. These methods involve embedding the sequences in a space where the similarities within a set of sequences can be closely approximated without having to compute all pair-wise distances. Conclusions: We show how this approach greatly reduces computation time and memory requirements for clustering large numbers of sequences and demonstrate the quality of the clusterings by benchmarking them as guide trees for multiple alignment.

abstract = {Dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium are important symbionts within corals and other benthic marine animals. The molecular diversity of Symbiodinium has been described mainly by use of ribosomal DNA sequence data. We tested whether minicircle sequences, which appear to form the chloroplast genome in many dinoflagellates, could be used as a marker for molecular diversity among symbionts found in corals and sea anemones. Partial and full-length sequences for psbA were obtained from environmental samples of coral and sea anemones of wide-ranging geographical distribution. Phylogenetic trees constructed with partial psbA sequences were consistent with the known phylotypes of the isolates. Further sequencing suggested that the psbA gene is present on a minicircle in all Symbiodinium phylotypes. The length and DNA sequence of the non-coding portion of the minicircles varied considerably among Symbiodinium phylotypes. In two Symbiodinium isolates from different phylotypes an elaborate pattern of repeat sequences of unknown function was found in the non-coding region. Phylogenetic analysis of the non-coding region of the psbA minicircle indicates that minicircle sequences could be a useful chloroplast-derived marker for differentiating both closely related and distantly related Symbiodinium isolates. ?? 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

The impact of introgressive hybridization and hybrid speciation has been documented especially in plant and animal assemblages. However, there remain certain areas of investigation for which natural hybridization and its consequences remain under-studied and under-appreciated. One such area involves the evolution of organisms that positively or negatively affect human populations. In this review, I highlight exemplars of how natural hybridization has contributed to the evolution of (i) domesticated plants and animals; (ii) pests; (iii) human disease vectors; and (iv) human pathogens. I focus on the effects from genetic exchange that may lead to the acquisition of novel phenotypes and thus increase the beneficial or detrimental (to human populations) aspects of the various taxa.},

abstract = {Flexibility in biological systems is seen as an important driver of macro-ecosystem function and stability. Spatially constrained endosymbiotic settings, however, are less studied, although environmental thresholds of symbiotic corals are linked to the function of their endosymbiotic dinoflagellate communities. Symbiotic flexibility is a hypothesized mechanism that corals may exploit to adapt to climate change. This study explores the flexibility of the coral-Symbiodinium symbiosis through quantification of Symbiodinium ITS2 sequence assemblages in a range of coral species and genera. Sequence assemblages are expressed as an index of flexibility incorporating phylogenetic divergence and relative abundance of Symbiodinium sequences recovered from the host. This comparative analysis reveals profound differences in the flexibility of corals for Symbiodinium, thereby classifying corals as generalists or specifists. Generalists such as Acropora and Pocillopora exhibit high intra- and inter-species flexibility in their Symbiodinium assemblages and are some of the most environmentally sensitive corals. Conversely, specifists such as massive Porites colonies exhibit low flexibility, harbour taxonomically narrow Symbiodinium assemblages, and are environmentally resistant corals. Collectively, these findings challenge the paradigm that symbiotic flexibility enhances holobiont resilience. This underscores the need for a deeper examination of the extent and duration of the functional benefits associated with endosymbiotic diversity and flexibility under environmental stress.},

abstract = {Reef-building corals throughout the world are considered endangered. The evidence is a decline in coral health and reduced coral cover. Competing hypotheses for the cause of coral loss include removal of grazers, nutrient enrichment, disease, coral bleaching, increase in temperature, and excess light/ultraviolet exposure. We suggest that light limitation as a second order effect of anthropogenic activity (e.g. sediment resuspension and nutrient enrichment) is a valid and tractable hypothesis. This experimental field and laboratory study demonstrates that corals of the Florida reefs are functioning close to the compensation point where respiration (of coral polyp plus zooxanthellae) consumes the products of photosynthesis of the zooxanthellae, with little if any remaining for growth.

abstract = {Reference phylogenies are crucial for providing a taxonomic framework for interpretation of marker gene and metagenomic surveys, which continue to reveal novel species at a remarkable rate. Greengenes is a dedicated full-length 16S rRNA gene database that provides users with a curated taxonomy based on de novo tree inference. We developed a 'taxonomy to tree' approach for transferring group names from an existing taxonomy to a tree topology, and used it to apply the Greengenes, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and cyanoDB (Cyanobacteria only) taxonomies to a de novo tree comprising 408,315 sequences. We also incorporated explicit rank information provided by the NCBI taxonomy to group names (by prefixing rank designations) for better user orientation and classification consistency. The resulting merged taxonomy improved the classification of 75{\%} of the sequences by one or more ranks relative to the original NCBI taxonomy with the most pronounced improvements occurring in under-classified environmental sequences. We also assessed candidate phyla (divisions) currently defined by NCBI and present recommendations for consolidation of 34 redundantly named groups. All intermediate results from the pipeline, which includes tree inference, jackknifing and transfer of a donor taxonomy to a recipient tree (tax2tree) are available for download. The improved Greengenes taxonomy should provide important infrastructure for a wide range of megasequencing projects studying ecosystems on scales ranging from our own bodies (the Human Microbiome Project) to the entire planet (the Earth Microbiome Project). The implementation of the software can be obtained from http://sourceforge.net/projects/tax2tree/.},

abstract = {The presence and diversity of free-living dinoflagellates belonging to the endosymbiotic genus Symbiodinium were explored in seawater samples collected above coral reefs in Ka ¯ne'ohe Bay, O'ahu, Hawai'i, and Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo, Mexico. Two genetic markers were used to assess Symbiodinium diversity in the water column: the internal transcribed spacer 2 region of the nuclear ribosomal array (ITS2), and a hypervariable region in domain V of the large subunit (23S) of the chloroplast ribosomal array (cp23S-HVR). Sequencing of cloned gene fragments reveals that clades B, C, D, and H Symbiodinium are detectable in the seawater samples. In addition to the previously described types B1, C3, C15, C21, and D1, novel Symbiodinium sequences belonging to clades B and C were also retrieved. The majority of Symbiodinium sequences recovered from Ka ¯ne'ohe Bay belonged to clade C and those from Puerto Morelos to clade B, a pattern that reflects the dominant types of Symbiodinium found in endosymbiosis with scleractinian corals in these two areas. This study represents the first direct assessment of Symbiodinium diversity in waters adjacent to coral reefs located in the Caribbean and the Pacific and confirms the presence of Symbiodinium in this compartment of the ecosystem. These data provide context for future studies examining spatial and temporal patterns in the availability of Symbiodinium in the water column, work that will ultimately promote a greater understanding of the interactions between symbiotic dinoflagellates and their environmentally sensitive benthic hosts.},

Approximately half of the improvement over the profile-profile comparison methods is attributable to the use of profile HMMs in place of simple profiles.

In certain taxa, ITS is nearly exclusively used for population level or inter-specific studies, despite the frequent presence of divergent paralogs within individual genomes that can be phylogenetically misleading. For the first time we survey diverse marine sponges to determine the extent and phylogenetic implications of intragenomic polymorphisms (IGPs) exhibited at their ITS loci. We discover that the extent of IGP varies greatly between taxa (with most taxa exhibiting very few) and cannot be predicted by taxonomy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ITS can be phylogenetically informative between species when moderate levels of IGPs are detected, but that ITS paralogy can interfere with population level studies. We caution against the routine use of ITS in phylogenetic studies of sponges without (1) screening for IGPs in specimens from every population sampled; (2) including all divergent paralogs in phylogenetic analyses; (3) testing ITS data using other single-copy, unlinked loci (such as nuclear introns). ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Molecular phylogeny of Symbiodinium, initially inferred using nuclear ribosomal genes, was recently confirmed by studies of chloroplastic and mitochondrial genes, but with limited taxon sampling and low resolution. Here, we present the first complete view of Symbiodinium phylogeny based on concatenated partial sequences of chloroplast 23S-rDNA (cp23S) and nuclear 28S-rDNA (nr28S) genes, including all known Symbiodinium lineages. Our data produced a well resolved phylogenetic tree and provide a strong statistical support for the eight distinctive clades (A-H) that form the major taxa of Symbiodinium. The relative-rate tests did not show particularly high differences between lineages and both analysed markers. However, maximum likelihood ratio tests rejected a global molecular clock. Therefore, we applied a relaxed molecular clock method to infer the divergence times of all extant lineages of Symbiodinium, calibrating its phylogenetic tree with the fossil record of soritid foraminifera. Our analysis suggests that Symbiodinium originated in early Eocene, and that the majority of extant lineages diversified since mid-Miocene, about 15 million years ago. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

We determined the bleaching resistance of Acropora aspera and Dipsastraea sp. from both intertidal and subtidal environments of the naturally extreme Kimberley region in northwest Australia. Here tides of up to 10 m can cause aerial exposure of corals and temperatures as high as 37 °C that fluctuate daily by up to 7 °C. Control corals were maintained at ambient nearshore temperatures which varied diurnally by 4-5 °C, while treatment corals were exposed to similar diurnal variations and heat stress corresponding to {\~{}}20 degree heating days. All corals hosted Symbiodinium clade C independent of treatment or origin. Detailed physiological measurements showed that these corals were nevertheless highly sensitive to daily average temperatures exceeding their maximum monthly mean of {\~{}}31 °C by 1 °C for only a few days. Generally, Acropora was much more susceptible to bleaching than Dipsastraea and experienced up to 75{\%} mortality, whereas all Dipsastraea survived. Furthermore, subtidal corals, which originated from a more thermally stable environment compared to intertidal corals, were more susceptible to bleaching. This demonstrates that while highly fluctuating temperatures enhance coral resilience to thermal stress, they do not provide immunity to extreme heat stress events.},

abstract = {Numerous marine invertebrates form endosymbiotic relationships with dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium, yet few studies have examined the population structure of these symbionts. Here, we elucidate the population genetic structure of Symbiodinium harboured by the Caribbean octocoral Gorgonia ventalina throughout the entire range of the host. We used ten microsatellite loci to survey 35 localities spanning 3124 km across the Caribbean and Western Atlantic. Diversity of Symbiodinium haplotypes was low within colonies of G. ventalina but high among colonies. Despite high haplotypic diversity, significant evidence of clonal reproduction in Symbiodinium was detected, and most clones occurred within localities, not among them. Pairwise measures of F(ST) illustrated significant differentiation in 98{\%} of comparisons between localities, suggesting low levels of gene flow. Clustering analyses identified six genetic groups whose distribution delimited four broad biogeographic regions. There was evidence of some connectivity among regions, corresponding with known geographic and oceanographic features. Fine-scale spatial surveys of G. ventalina colonies failed to detect differentiation among Symbiodinium at the metre scale. However, significant differentiation was observed among Symbiodinium hosted by sympatric G. ventalina colonies of different size/age classes. This cohort effect suggests that Symbiodinium may have an epidemic population structure, whereby G. ventalina recruits are infected by the locally predominant symbiont strain(s), which change over time.},

abstract = {Many scleractinian corals must acquire their endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (genus Symbiodinium) anew each generation from environmental pools, and exchange between endosymbiotic and environmental pools of Symbiodinium (reef waters and sediments) has been proposed as a mechanism for optimizing coral physiology in the face of environmental change. Our understanding of the diversity of Symbiodinium spp. in environmental pools is poor by comparison to that engaged in endosymbiosis, which reflects the challenges of visualizing the genus against the backdrop of the complex and diverse micro-eukaryotic communities found free-living in the environment. Here, the molecular diversity of Symbiodinium living in the waters and sediments of a reef near Coconut Island, O'ahu, Hawai'i, sampled at four hourly intervals over a period of 5 d was characterized using a Symbiodinium-specific hypervariable region of the chloroplast 23S. A comparison of Symbiodinium spp. diversity recovered from environmental samples with the endosymbiotic diversity in coral species that dominate the adjacent reef revealed limited overlap between these communities. These data suggest that the potential for infection, exchange, and/or repopulation of corals with Symbiodinium derived from the environment is limited at this location, a finding that is perhaps consistent with the high proportion of coral species in this geographic region that transmit endosymbionts from generation to generation.},

Coral cover declined from 40 to 28{\{}{\%}{\}} between 1994 and 2010, and 3 of the 12 sampled colonies increased in size, while 9 decreased in size. The relative abundance of {\{}{\textless}{\}}i{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}Symbiodinium{\{}{\textless}{\}}/i{\{}{\textgreater}{\}} clades varied among corals over time, and patterns of change differed between photoquadrats but not among host genotypes. {\{}{\textless}{\}}i{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}Symbiodinium{\{}{\textless}{\}}/i{\{}{\textgreater}{\}} communities in 8 corals in 1 photoquadrat differed among colonies and changed over time, with a trend towards reduced abundance of clade C and increased abundance of clade B. {\{}{\textless}{\}}i{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}Symbiodinium{\{}{\textless}{\}}/i{\{}{\textgreater}{\}} communities in 4 corals in the second photoquadrat were similar among colonies, dominated by clade C, and remained relatively constant in clade composition over time. Based on an analysis that sampled only a small number of corals, but is unique in the long temporal scale and the combination of techniques employed, this study demonstrates that the processes underlying shifts in coral cover are complex and difficult to predict.

It was found: (a) The average amount of DCIP reduced per flash declined drastically with increasing irradiation time in the absence of DPC but remained almost unaffected in its presence, (b) After UV-B irradiation, the maximum amplitude of laser flash induced 830 nm absorption changes decreases only slightly; whereas the relaxation kinetics exhibit marked effects: the (JLS components dominate the decay at the expense of ns components. The $\gamma$.s kinetics already arise after illumination with a single flash of dark adapted samples, (c) The manganese content decreases only partly at irradiation times where the oxygen evolution capacity is almost completely lost, (d) The polypeptide pattern is hardly affected; the number of atrazine binding sites markedly decreases. Based on the results of this study, UV-B irradiation is inferred to deteriorate primarily the function of water oxidation. The action spectrum of the UV-B effect does not reveal a specific target molecule. It is assumed that structural changes of the D-l/D-2 polypeptide matrix are responsible for the modification by UV-B irradiation of the capacity of water oxidation and atrazine binding.},

abstract = {In the context of rising seawater temperatures associated with climate change, the issue of whether coral holobionts deal with this challenge by shuffling their associations with stress- and/or heat-tolerant Symbiodinium, by generating heat-resistant host genotypes, or both is important for coral survival. In this study, the composition of communities of the endosymbiont Symbiodinium and the population genetics of the coral host Platygyra verweyi were examined in a reef impacted by hot-water discharged from the outlet of a nuclear power plant in operation in Kenting, Southern Taiwan since 1984. The water at this site is 2.0-3.0 °C warmer than adjacent reefs in summer, which have an average seawater temperature of 29.0 °C. The data were compared with those for the same species at other sites within 12 km of the outlet site. Platygyra verwyei was associated with one or both of Symbiodinium types C3 (heat sensitive) and D1a (heat tolerant) at all sites with the latter being the dominant at the nuclear power plant outlet. The proportion of C3 in populations increased gradually with increasing distance from the hot-water discharge. Genetic analysis of the Platygyra verweyi host using mitochondrial and nuclear markers showed no genetic differentiation among sites. Changes in the composition of Symbiodinium types associated with P. verweyi among closely located sites in Kenting suggested that this coral might have acclimatized to the constant thermal stress by selective association with heat-tolerant Symbiodinium types, whereas the role of the host in adaptation was inconclusive.},

In addition to fixed differences in DNA sequences, recent genetics-based descriptions within the dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium have incorporated confirmatory morphological, physiological, and ecological evidence when possible. However, morphological and physiological data are difficult to collect from species that have not been cultured, while the natural ecologies of many cultured species remain unknown. Here, we rely on genetic evidence—the only data consistently available among all taxa investigated—to describe four new Clade B Symbiodinium species. The ‘host-specialized' species (S. antillogorgium sp. nov. and S. endomadracis sp. nov.) engage in mutualisms with specific cnidarian hosts, but exhibit differences in our ability to culture them in vitro. The ecologically ‘cryptic' species (S. aenigmaticum sp. nov. and S. pseudominutum sp. nov.) thrive in culture, but their roles or functions in the ecosystem (i.e., niches) are yet to be documented. These new species call further attention to the spectrum of ecological guilds among Symbiodinium.},

Researchers in this field can combine the high resolution of genetic markers with spatial data and a variety of statistical methods to evaluate the role that landscape variables play in shaping genetic diversity and population structure. While interest in this research area is growing rapidly, our ability to fully utilize landscape data, test explicit hypotheses and truly integrate these diverse disciplines has lagged behind. Part of the current challenge in the development of the field of landscape genetics is bridging the communication and knowledge gap between these highly specific and technical disciplines. The goal of this review is to help bridge this gap by exposing geneticists to terminology, sampling methods and analysis techniques widely used in landscape ecology and spatial statistics but rarely addressed in the genetics literature. We offer a definition for the term "landscape genetics", provide an overview of the landscape genetics literature, give guidelines for appropriate sampling design and useful analysis techniques, and discuss future directions in the field. We hope, this review will stimulate increased dialog and enhance interdisciplinary collaborations advancing this exciting new field.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The ability of reef corals to adapt or acclimatize to projected climate change is a critical, but controversial, question in contemporary coral reef science and conservation. Much research has focused on whether or not corals are able to flexibly associate with diverse symbionts ('zooxanthellae') whose different physiologies may impart greater resistance to environmental extremes. Goulet (2006; Mar Ecol Prog Ser 321:1-7) concluded that most coral species only host zooxanthellae from a single Symbiodinium clade, and that these symbionts do not change in response to environmental disturbance, disease, or temperature stress. We re-evaluate her data and show that: (1) almost two-thirds of the coral species investigated have been severely undersampled (N {\textless}= 5); (2) more than three-quarters of the scleractinian (stony) coral species sampled more adequately (N {\textgreater} 10) host multiple Symbiodinium clades, or multiple types within a clade; (3) scleractinian corals are more flexible than octocorals; (4) almost all scleractinian coral families can host more than one symbiont clade. Moreover, the molecular approaches used by many studies are likely to have underestimated Symbiodinium diversity, because they are unable to detect symbionts at low abundance and because they cannot distinguish between closely related types. In addition, various other studies show that: (1) scleractinian corals commonly host multiple symbiont types within a Symbiodinium clade; (2) symbiont communities in scleractinian corals are dynamic; (3) 'cryptic' symbiont taxa found at low abundance within colonies are unlikely to be molecular artifacts. We suggest that the majority of scleractinian coral species, including virtually all of the dominant reef-building taxa, can be found hosting multiple symbiont types, even at the clade level. This flexibility is important in understanding the past evolutionary success of these species and their future survival trajectories in the face of projected climate change.},

One hundred and eleven colonies of seven species of Acropora (A. abrolhosensis; A. cerealis/nasuta; A. digitifera; A. millepora; A. papillare; A. spicifera; and A. tenuis) were sampled at sites in the Ningaloo Marine Park, Western Australia. Our study shows the presence of multiple Symbiodinium clades in 45{\%} of all the Acropora colonies studied. The commonest clades were B and C, most often occurring together in single colonies. Clade A was found in a single colony of A. cerealis/nasuta, with clades B and C in the same colony. Clade D was found in a single colony of A. millepora, with clades B and C in the same colony. There was no significant correlation between clade, depth, coral species, colony size, or site. Our work supports the suggestion that the potential for symbiont shuffling in corals is significant.

abstract = {Recently, researchers in several areas of ecology and evolution have begun to change the way in which they analyze data and make biological inferences. Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

abstract = {Coral endosymbionts in the dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium are known to impact host physiology and have led to the evolution of reef-building, but less is known about how symbiotic communities in early life-history stages and their interactions with host parental identity shape the structure of coral communities on reefs. Differentiating the roles of environmental and biological factors driving variation in population demographic processes, particularly larval settlement, early juvenile survival and the onset of symbiosis is key to understanding how coral communities are structured and to predicting how they are likely to respond to climate change. We show that maternal effects (that here include genetic and/or effects related to the maternal environment) can explain nearly 24{\%} of variation in larval settlement success and 5–17{\%} of variation in juvenile survival in an experimental study of the reef-building scleractinian coral, Acropora tenuis. After 25 days on the reef, Symbiodinium communities associated with juvenile corals differed significantly between high mortality and low mortality families based on estimates of taxonomic richness, composition and relative abundance of taxa. Our results highlight that maternal and familial effects significantly explain variation in juvenile survival and symbiont communities in a broadcast-spawning coral, with Symbiodinium type A3 possibly a critical symbiotic partner during this early life stage.},

abstract = {Seasonal variation in the composition of the algal endosymbiont community and photophysiology was determined in the corals Pocillopora damicornis, which show high local fidelity to one symbiont type (Symbiodinium C1), and Acropora valida, with a mixed Symbiodinium symbiont community, comprising members of both clades A and C. The relative abundances of Symbiodinium types varied over time. A significant decline in symbiont densities in both coral species during the summer of 2005 coincided with a NOAA 'hotspot' warning for Heron Island. This also coincided with a relative increase in the presence and dominance of clade A in A. valida, particularly in sun-adapted surfaces. The effective quantum yield of Photosystem II (Phi(PSII)) suggested that sun-adapted surfaces of P. damicornis are more sensitive than shade-adapted surfaces to combined effects of higher temperature and irradiance in summer. Xanthophyll cycling was greater in P. damicornis than A. valida, irrespective of branch position and sampling time; this may be a mechanism by which P. damicornis compensates for its fidelity to Symbiodinium C1. Furthermore, xanthophyll de-epoxidation in P. damicornis symbionts was greater in sun-adapted than shade-adapted surfaces, correlating with non-photochemical quenching (NPQ(RLC)). No variation was found in A. valida, indicating that resident symbiont communities may not have been physiologically compromised, perhaps as a result of changes in the composition of the Symbiodinium community consortia.},

Numerous studies have revealed that the genus is comprised of a group of diverse taxa, and information on the phylogenetic relationships among the genus' members is increasing. In this study, small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (ssrRNA) gene sequences were determined for 15 more Symbiodinium strains from 12 relatively unstudied host taxa (Indo-Pacific tridacnids, cardiids, sponge, and soft coral), 1 hitherto unreported free-living Symbiodinium strain, and 4 other Symbiodinium strains from four other host taxa (Indo-Pacific zoanthid, foraminifer, jellyfish, and mid-Pacific hard coral). Their respective phylogenetic positions were inferred, and strains that are either closely related to or distinct from previously reported Symbiodinium taxa were revealed. The cultured Symbiodinium strains isolated from individuals of six species of tridacnids and three species of cardiids all had identical ssrRNA gene sequences, are closely related to S. microadriaticum Freudenthal, and are indistinguishable from the RFLP Type A strain previously reported. However, the ssrRNA gene sequences of clam symbionts that were obtained via gene cloning were different from those of the cultured isolates and represent strains that are close to the RFLP Type C strains. The Symbiodinium-like dinoflagellate from the Indo-Pacific sponge Haliclona koremella De Laubenfels is distinct from any of the Symbiodinium taxa studied and may be similar to the symbiont previously isolated from the stony coral Montipora patula Quelch. The isolates from the soft coral Sarcophyton glaucum Quoy et Gaimard and from the zoanthid Zoanthus sp. are both very closely related to S. pilosum Trench et Blank. The free-living Symbiodinium isolate is very closely related to the symbiont isolated from the Indo-Pacific foraminifer Amphisorus hemprichii Ehrenberg, which in turn is distinct from the Red Sea strain isolated from a similar host. The isolate from Cassiopeia sp. is different from S. microadriaticum F., the type species harbored by Cassiopeia xamachana Bigelow, and is instead very closely related to S. pulchrorum Trench isolated from a sea anemone. The symbiont from the stony coral M. verrucosa Lamarck is a sister taxon to the symbionts isolated from the foraminifera Marginopora kudakajimensis Gudmundsson and Sorites orbiculus Forska° l. These data suggest that polymorphic symbioses extend from cnidarians to some bivalve, foraminifer, and jellyfish host species.},

abstract = {The response of the coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi (Lohmann) W. H. Hay et H. Mohler to acute exposure to high photon flux densities (PFD) was examined in terms of PSII photoinhibition, photoprotection, and photorepair. The time and light dependencies of these processes were characterized as a function of the photoacclimation state of the alga. Low-light (LL) acclimated cells displayed a higher degree of photoinhibition, measured as decline in F(v)/F(m), than high-light (HL) acclimated cells. However, HL cultures were more susceptible to photodamage but also more capable of compensating for it by performing a faster repair cycle. The relation between gross photoinhibition (observed in the presence of an inhibitor of repair) and PFD to which the algae were exposed deviated from linearity at high PFD, which calls into question the universality of current concepts of photoinhibition in mechanistic models. The light dependence of the de-epoxidation state (DPS) of the xanthophyll cycle (XC) pigments on the timescale of hours was the same in cells acclimated to LL and HL. However, HL cells were more efficient in realizing nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) on short timescales, most likely due to a larger XC pool. LL cells displayed an increase in the PSII effective cross-section (sigma(PSII)) as a result of photoinhibition, which was observed also in HL cells when net photoinhibition was induced by blocking the D1 repair cycle. The link between sigma(PSII) and photoinhibition suggests that the population of PSII reaction centers (RCIIs) of E. huxleyi shares a common antenna, according to a "lake" organization of the light-harvesting complex.},

In this study, five clonal iso- lates from the eastern coast of North America, one from New Zealand, and a mixed composite of clones were cultured in aquaria and fed live fish. Division, sexuality, and phagotrophic feeding on fish were studied by LM, SEM, and flow cytometry. The devel- opment of reproductive cysts isolated from aquaria was followed. Synchronously excysted flagellate pop- ulations were examined for sexuality and then for feeding behavior and reproduction when given larval fish. Reproductive cysts varied in size and underwent protoplast division(s), most commonly producing two to eight biflagellated offspring. Fusing gametes, re- sulting planozygotes, and nuclear cyclosis were docu- mented as evidence of sexuality. Gametes emerged from cysts, and fusions were approximately isoga- mous. Resulting planozygotes had two longitudinal flagella and one transverse flagellum and apparently fed before encysting. Distinct and lengthy chromo- some movements (nuclear cyclosis) occurred in pre- sumed zygotic cysts before nuclear division(s). These cysts did not exhibit dormancy in growing cultures and produced two or four biflagellated offspring. Flagellated cells fed on surficial fish tissues and then encysted for reproduction. Stages indicating a com- pleted sexual cycle (fusion, planozygotes, and nu- clear cyclosis) were uncommon or absent in clonal cultures but were relatively abundant in the mixed clone culture. Self-sterility factors apparently influ- enced sexuality. Starved populations formed quies- cent cysts that released swimming cells when food was provided. Pfiesteria shumwayae was similar in re- production and sexuality to closely related species.},

abstract = {Discrepancies between morphology-based taxonomy and phylogenetic systematics are common in Scleractinian corals. In Pocillopora corals, nine recently identified genetic lineages disagree fundamentally with the 17 recognized Pocillopora species, including 5 major Indo-Pacific reef-builders. Pocillopora corals hybridize in the Tropical Eastern Pacific, so it is possible that some of the disagreement between the genetics and taxonomy may be due to introgressive hybridization. Here we used 6769 genome-wide SNPs from Restriction-site Associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-Seq) to conduct phylogenomic comparisons among three common, Indo-Pacific Pocillopora species - P. damicornis, P. eydouxi and P. elegans - within and between populations in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) and the Central Pacific. Genome-wide RAD-Seq comparisons of Central and TEP Pocillopora confirm that the morphospecies P. damicornis, P. eydouxi and P. elegans are not monophyletic, but instead fall into three distinct genetic groups. However, hybrid samples shared fixed alleles with their respective parental species and, even without strict monophyly, P. damicornis share a common set of 33 species-specific alleles across the Pacific. RAD-Seq data confirm the pattern of one-way introgressive hybridization among TEP Pocillopora, suggesting that introgression may play a role in generating shared, polyphyletic lineages among currently recognized Pocillopora species. Levels of population differentiation within genetic lineages indicate significantly higher levels of population differentiation in the Tropical Eastern Pacific than in the Central West Pacific.},

abstract = {Polyploidy is a prominent process in plant evolution; yet few data address the question of whether homeologous sequences evolve independently subsequent to polyploidization. We report on ribosomal DNA (rDNA) evolution in five allopolyploid (AD genome) species of cotton (Gossypium) and species representing their diploid progenitors (A genome, D genome). Sequence data from the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS1 and ITS2) and the 5.8S gene indicate that rDNA arrays are homogeneous, or nearly so, in all diploids and allopolyploids examined. Because these arrays occur at four chromosomal loci in allopolyploid cotton, two in each subgenome, repeats from different arrays must have become homogenized by interlocus concerted evolution. Southern hybridization analysis combined with copy-number estimation demonstrate that this process has gone to completion in the diploids and to completion or near-completion in all allopolyploid species and that it most likely involves the entire rDNA repeat. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that interlocus concerted evolution has been bidirectional in allopolyploid species--i.e., rDNA from four polyploid lineages has been homogenized to a D genome repeat type, whereas sequences from Gossypium mustelinum have concerted to an A genome repeat type. Although little is known regarding the functional significance of interlocus concerted evolution of homeologous sequences, this study demonstrates that the process occurs for tandemly repeated sequences in diploid and polyploid plants. That interlocus concerted evolution can occur bidirectionally subsequent to hybidization and polyploidization has significant implications for phylogeny reconstruction, especially when based on rDNA sequences.},

abstract = {Large discoidal soritid foraminiferans (Soritinae) are abundant in coral reef ecosystems. As with the many cnidarian invertebrates that inhabit these systems, they also depend on symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium) for their growth and survival. Several particular Symbiodinium sub-genera or clades inhabit these soritids. One of these groups, referred to as clade C, dominates corals and their relatives throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific. In contrast, the distributions of Symbiodinium spp. from clades A, B, and C are more evenly apportioned across Caribbean invertebrate communities. To explore the possibility that a similar biogeographic break exists in the symbionts harbored by soritids, we surveyed the Symbiodinium spp. from the soritid genus Sorites, collected from the Pacific and Caribbean coasts of Panama as well as from Florida. Characterization of Symbiodinium obtained from foraminiferal and cnidarian samples was conducted using restriction fragment length polymorphism and phylogenetic analyses of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS 2) and a portion of the large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences. A distinctive biogeographic break between the kinds of symbionts found in Sorites from the East Pacific and Caribbean was clearly evident. Differences between cnidarian and foraminferan symbioses in each ocean may be explained by the subjection of Caribbean communities to severer environmental conditions during the early Quarternary. Caribbean Sorites spp. harbored symbionts described from clade F (specifically sub-clade Fr4) and clade H formally referred to as Fr1), while Sorites spp. from the eastern Pacific were dominated by a single Symbiodinium haplotype in clade C. An ITS 2 phylogeny determined that most clade C "types'' recovered from Indo-Pacific soritids form a monophyletic sub-lineage with other clade C symbionts typically found in Pacific corals from the genus Porites. The existence of multiple Symbiodinium lineages at various taxonomic levels associated specifically with soritids indicates that symbioses with these hosts are important in driving Symbiodinium spp. evolution.},

Recently, whole genome amplification has been achieved from small quantities of genomic DNA by isothermal amplification with bacteriophage 29 DNA polymerase- and exonuclease-resistant random hexamer primers. Here we report that isothermal whole genome amplification from single and small numbers of lymphocytes and blastomeres isolated from cleavage stage embryos yielded microgram quantities of amplified DNA, and allowed analysis of 20 different loci, including the DeltaF508 deletion causing cystic fibrosis and polymorphic repeat sequences used in DNA fingerprinting. As with analysis by PCR-based methods, some preferential amplification or allele drop-out at heterozygous loci was detected with single cells. With 2-5 cells, amplification was more consistent and with 10 or 20 cells results were indistinguishable from genomic DNA. The use of isothermal whole genome amplification as a universal first step marks a new era for PGD since, unlike previous PCR-based methods, sufficient DNA is amplified for diagnosis of any known single gene defect by standard methods and conditions.},

Because the zooxanthellae are localized on one side of the ovum-and later, within the blastomeres at one end of the embryo-invagination leads to the zooxanthellae being restricted to the planular endoderm and hence to the gastrodermal cells of the adult anemone.

abstract = {The genotypic composition of populations of the asexually viviparous coral Pocillopora damicornis varies in a manner that challenges classical models of the roles of sexual and asexual reproduction. On the geographically isolated Hawaiian reefs and high latitude reefs in Western Australia, P. damicornis populations are highly clonal although it has been argued that sexual reproduction via broadcast spawning generates widely dispersed colonists. In contrast, on eastern Australia's tropical Great Barrier Reef populations show little evidence of clonality. Here, we compare the genotypic diversity of adult and juvenile colonies of P. damicornis at seven sites on eastern Australia's high latitude Lord Howe Island reefs to determine if levels of clonality vary with habitat heterogeneity and age of colonies (as predicted by theory) or alternatively if clonality is again always high as for other isolated reef systems. We found 55-100{\%} of the genotypic diversity expected for random mating at all seven sites and little evidence of asexual recruitment irrespective of habitat heterogeneity (sheltered versus wave exposed) or colony age. We found reduced levels of genetic diversity compared with tropical reefs (2.75 versus 4 alleles/locus), which supports earlier findings that Lord Howe Island is an isolated reef system. Furthermore, heterozygote deficits coupled with significant genetic subdivision among sites (FST=0.102+/-0.03) is typical of populations that have limited larval connections and are inbred. We conclude that the genetic structure of P. damicornis at Lord Howe Island reflects populations that are maintained through localised recruitment of sexually produced larvae.},

abstract = {Stony corals in the genus Pocillopora are among the most common and widely distributed of Indo-Pacific corals and, as such, are often the subject of physiological and ecological research. In the far Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP), they are major constituents of shallow coral communities, exhibiting considerable variability in colony shape and branch morphology and marked differences in response to thermal stress. Numerous intermediates occur between morphospecies that may relate to extensive hybridization. The diversity of the Pocillopora genus in the TEP was analysed genetically using nuclear ribosomal (ITS2) and mitochondrial (ORF) sequences, and population genetic markers (seven microsatellite loci). The resident dinoflagellate endosymbiont (Symbiodinium sp.) in each sample was also characterized using sequences of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) rDNA and the noncoding region of the chloroplast psbA minicircle. From these analyses, three symbiotically distinct, reproductively isolated, nonhybridizing, evolutionarily divergent animal lineages were identified. Designated types 1, 2 and 3, these groupings were incongruent with traditional morphospecies classification. Type 1 was abundant and widespread throughout the TEP; type 2 was restricted to the Clipperton Atoll; and type 3 was found only in Panama and the Galapagos Islands. Each type harboured a different Symbiodinium'species lineage' in Clade C, and only type 1 associated with the 'stress-tolerant'Symbiodinium glynni (D1). The accurate delineation of species and implementation of a proper taxonomy may profoundly improve our assessment of Pocillopora's reproductive biology, biogeographic distributions, and resilience to climate warming, information that must be considered when planning for the conservation of reef corals.},

Here we use microsatellite loci and hierarchical clustering analysis to investigate cryptic diversity in sympatric and allopatric (separated by 450 km) populations of the widespread coral Seriatopora hystrix on the Great Barrier Reef. Structure analyses delimited unique genetic clusters that were confirmed by phylogenetic and extensive population-level analyses. Each of four sympatric yet distinct genetic clusters detected within S. hystrix demonstrated greater genetic cohesion across regional scales than between genetic clusters within regions ({\textless}10km). Moreover, the magnitude of genetic differentiation between different clusters ({\textgreater}0.620 G”ST) was similar to the difference between S. hystrix clusters and the congener S. caliendrum (mean G”ST 0.720). Multiple lines of evidence, including differences in habitat specificity, mitochondrial identity, Symbiodinium associations and morphology, corroborate the nuclear genetic evidence that these distinct clusters constitute different species. Hierarchical clustering analysis combined with more traditional population genetic methods provide a powerful approach for delimiting species and should be regularly applied to ensure that ecological and evolutionary patterns interpreted for single species are not confounded by the presence of cryptic species.

abstract = {Sea temperatures in many tropical regions have increased by almost 1°C over the past 100 years, and are currently increasing at {\~{}}1–2°C per century. Coral bleaching occurs when the thermal tol- erance of corals and their photosynthetic symbionts (zooxanthellae) is exceeded. Mass coral bleaching has occurred in association with episodes of elevated sea temperatures over the past 20 years and involves the loss of the zooxanthellae following chronic photoinhibition. Mass bleaching has resulted in signifi- cant losses of live coral in many parts of the world. This paper considers the biochemical, physiological and ecological perspectives of coral bleaching. It also uses the outputs of four runs from three models of global climate change which simulate changes in sea temperature and hence how the frequency and inten- sity of bleaching events will change over the next 100 years. The results suggest that the thermal toler- ances of reef-building corals are likely to be exceeded every year within the next few decades. Events as severe as the 1998 event, the worst on record, are likely to become commonplace within 20 years. Most information suggests that the capacity for acclimation by corals has already been exceeded, and that adap- tation will be too slow to avert a decline in the quality of the world's reefs. The rapidity of the changes that are predicted indicates a major problem for tropical marine ecosystems and suggests that unrestrained warming cannot occur without the loss and degradation of coral reefs on a global scale.},

abstract = {We describe a new method (T-Coffee) for multiple sequence alignment that provides a dramatic improvement in accuracy with a modest sacrifice in speed as compared to the most commonly used alternatives. The method is broadly based on the popular progressive approach to multiple alignment but avoids the most serious pitfalls caused by the greedy nature of this algorithm. With T-Coffee we pre-process a data set of all pair-wise alignments between the sequences. This provides us with a library of alignment information that can be used to guide the progressive alignment. Intermediate alignments are then based not only on the sequences to be aligned next but also on how all of the sequences align with each other. This alignment information can be derived from heterogeneous sources such as a mixture of alignment programs and/or structure superposition. Here, we illustrate the power of the approach by using a combination of local and global pair-wise alignments to generate the library. The resulting alignments are significantly more reliable, as determined by comparison with a set of 141 test cases, than any of the popular alternatives that we tried. The improvement, especially clear with the more difficult test cases, is always visible, regardless of the phylogenetic spread of the sequences in the tests.},

These methods are starting to become a bottleneck in some analysis pipelines when faced with data sets of the size of many thousands of sequences. Some methods allow computation of larger data sets while sacrificing quality, and others produce high-quality alignments, but scale badly with the number of sequences. In this paper, we describe a new program called Clustal Omega, which can align virtually any number of protein sequences quickly and that delivers accurate alignments. The accuracy of the package on smaller test cases is similar to that of the high-quality aligners. On larger data sets, Clustal Omega outperforms other packages in terms of execution time and quality. Clustal Omega also has powerful features for adding sequences to and exploiting information in existing alignments, making use of the vast amount of precomputed information in public databases like Pfam.},

abstract = {Cnidarian bleaching is a breakdown in the mutualistic symbiosis between host Cnidarians, such as reef building corals, and their unicellular photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbionts. Bleaching is caused by a variety of environmental stressors, most notably elevated temperatures associated with global climate change in conjunction with high solar radiation, and it is a major contributor to coral death and reef degradation. This review examines the underlying cellular events that lead to symbiosis dysfunction and cause bleaching, emphasizing that, to date, we have only some pieces of a complex cellular jigsaw puzzle. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated by damage to both photosynthetic and mitochondrial membranes, is shown to play a central role in both injury to the partners and to inter-partner communication of a stress response. Evidence is presented that suggests that bleaching is a host innate immune response to a compromised symbiont, much like innate immune responses in other host-microbe interactions. Finally, the elimination or exit of the symbiont from host tissues is described through a variety of mechanisms including exocytosis, host cell detachment and host cell apoptosis.},

abstract = {Coral reefs across the world have been seriously degraded and have a bleak future in response to predicted global warming and ocean acidification (OA). However, this is not the first time that biocalcifying organisms, including corals, have faced the threat of extinction. The end-Triassic mass extinction (200 million years ago) was the most severe biotic crisis experienced by modern marine invertebrates, which selected against biocalcifiers; this was followed by the proliferation of another invertebrate group, sponges. The duration of this sponge-dominated period far surpasses that of alternative stable-ecosystem or phase-shift states reported on modern day coral reefs and, as such, a shift to sponge-dominated reefs warrants serious consideration as one future trajectory of coral reefs. We hypothesise that some coral reefs of today may become sponge reefs in the future, as sponges and corals respond differently to changing ocean chemistry and environmental conditions. To support this hypothesis, we discuss: (i) the presence of sponge reefs in the geological record; (ii) reported shifts from coral- to sponge-dominated systems; and (iii) direct and indirect responses of the sponge holobiont and its constituent parts (host and symbionts) to changes in temperature and pH. Based on this evidence, we propose that sponges may be one group to benefit from projected climate change and ocean acidification scenarios, and that increased sponge abundance represents a possible future trajectory for some coral reefs, which would have important implications for overall reef functioning.},

These equations for different solvents give chlorophyll assays that are consistent with each other. No algorithms for Chl c compounds (c2, c1 + c2) in the presence of Chl a have previously been published for methanol or ethanol. The limits of detection (and inherent error, +/- 95{\%} confidence limit), for chlorophylls in all organisms tested, was generally less than 0.1 microg/ml. The Chl a and b algorithms for green algae and land plants have very small inherent errors ({\textless} 0.01 microg/ml). Chl a and d algorithms for Acaryochloris marina are consistent with each other, giving estimates of Chl d/a ratios which are consistent with previously published estimates using HPLC and a rarely used algorithm originally published for diethyl ether in 1955. The statistical error structure of chlorophyll algorithms is discussed. The relative error of measurements of chlorophylls increases hyperbolically in diluted chlorophyll extracts because the inherent errors of the chlorophyll algorithms are constants independent of the magnitude of absorbance readings. For safety reasons, efficient extraction of chlorophylls and the convenience of being able to use polystyrene cuvettes, the algorithms for ethanol are recommended for routine assays of chlorophylls. The methanol algorithms would be convenient for assays associated with HPLC work.},

In comparing a pair of nucleotide sequences, we distinguish two types of differ-ences; if homologous sites are occupied by different nucleotide bases but both are purines or both pyrimidines, the difference is called type I (or "tran-sition" type), while, if one of the two is a purine and the other is a pyrimi-dine, the difference is called type I1 (or "transversion" type). Letting P and Q be respectively the fractions of nucleotide sites showing type I and type II differences between two sequences compared, then the evolutionary distance per site is K = --(1/2) In {\{}{\{}{\}}(1 --2P --Q) {\{}{\~{}}{\}} z -{\{}{\~{}}{\}} {\{}{\}}{\}} . The evolutionary rate per year is then given by k = K/(2T), where T is the time since the divergence of the two sequences. If only the third codon positions are compared, the syn-onymous component of the evolutionary base substitutions per site is esti-mated by K' S = --(1/2) In (1 --2P --0.).

Therefore, it is de-sirable if good statistical methods are established for estimating evolutionary distances between homologous sequences in terms of the number of nucleotide base substitutions. Recently, Miyata and Yasunaga (1980) proposed a new method for this purpose. Theil method consists in tracing, through successive one step changes, all the possible paths (restricted by the assumption of "the minimum substitution number") for each pair of codons compared, giving each step its due weight based on relative acceptance rates of amino acid substitutions. Using this method they succeeded in revealing some inter-esting properties of synonymous base substitutions. One drawback of their method, however, is that it is too tedious. The purpose of this note is to derive some simple formulae which enable us to ob-tain reliable estimates on the evolutionary distances between two nucleotide sequences compared. The present method of estimation is not only handy but also has the merit of incorporating the possibility that sometimes "transition" type substitutions may oc-cur more frequently than "transversion" type substitutions. Let us compare two homologous sequences and suppose that n nucleotide sites are involved. In what follows, we express sequences in terms of RNA codes, so that the four bases are designated by letters U, C, A and G. Now, we fix our attention on one of the n sites, and investigate how the homologous sites in two species differentiate from each other in the course of evolution, starting from a common ancestor T years back. Since there are 4 possibilities with respect to a base occupied at each site, there are 16 combinations of base pairs when the homol-ogous sites in two species are compared. These are listed in Table 1. For example, UU in the first line represents the case in which homologous sites in the first and sec-ond species are both occupied by base U. Similarly, UC in the second line represents the case in which homologous sites in the first and second species are occupied by U and C. Table 1. Types of nucleotide base pairs occupied at homologous sites in two species. Type I difference includes four cases in which both are purines or both are pyrimidines (line 2). Type II difference consists of eight cases in which one of the bases is a purine and the other is a pyri-midine (lines 3 and 4).},

abstract = {Bursts in species diversification are well documented among animals and plants, yet few studies have assessed recent adaptive radiations of eukaryotic microbes. Consequently, we examined the radiation of the most ecologically dominant group of endosymbiotic dinoflagellates found in reef-building corals, Symbiodinium Clade C, using nuclear ribosomal (ITS2), chloroplast (psbA(ncr)), and multilocus microsatellite genotyping. Through a hierarchical analysis of high-resolution genetic data, we assessed whether ecologically distinct Symbiodinium, differentiated by seemingly equivocal rDNA sequence differences, are independent species lineages. We also considered the role of host specificity in Symbiodinium speciation and the correspondence between endosymbiont diversification and Caribbean paleo-history. According to phylogenetic, biological, and ecological species concepts, Symbiodinium Clade C comprises many distinct species. Although regional factors contributed to population-genetic structuring of these lineages, Symbiodinium diversification was mainly driven by host specialization. By combining patterns of the endosymbiont's host specificity, water depth distribution, and phylogeography with paleo-historical signals of climate change, we inferred that present-day species diversity on Atlantic coral reefs stemmed mostly from a post-Miocene adaptive radiation. Host-generalist progenitors spread, specialized, and diversified during the ensuing epochs of prolonged global cooling and change in reef-faunal assemblages. Our evolutionary reconstruction thus suggests that Symbiodinium undergoes "boom and bust" phases in diversification and extinction during major climate shifts.},

abstract = {Elevated temperature (28-34 degrees C) has been hypothesized as the primary cause of the loss of algal endosymbionts in coral reef-associated invertebrates, a phenomenon observed on a world-wide scale over the last decade. In past studies of this "bleaching" phenomenon, there has been an underlying assumption that temperature adversely affects the animal hosts, the algae thereby being relegated to a more passive role. Because photosynthesis is a sensitive indicator of thermal stress in plants and has a central role in the nutrition of symbiotic invertebrates, we have tested the hypothesis that elevated temperature adversely affects photosynthesis in the symbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium microadriaticum. The results, based on analyses of light-mediated O2 evolution and in vivo fluorescence, indicate that photosynthesis is impaired at temperatures above 30 degrees C and ceases completely at 34-36 degrees C. These observations are discussed in the context of possible mechanisms that may function in the disassociation of algal-invertebrate symbioses in response to elevated temperature.},

abstract = {Hybridization has many and varied impacts on the process of speciation. Hybridization may slow or reverse differentiation by allowing gene flow and recombination. It may accelerate speciation via adaptive introgression or cause near-instantaneous speciation by allopolyploidization. It may have multiple effects at different stages and in different spatial contexts within a single speciation event. We offer a perspective on the context and evolutionary significance of hybridization during speciation, highlighting issues of current interest and debate. In secondary contact zones, it is uncertain if barriers to gene flow will be strengthened or broken down due to recombination and gene flow. Theory and empirical evidence suggest the latter is more likely, except within and around strongly selected genomic regions. Hybridization may contribute to speciation through the formation of new hybrid taxa, whereas introgression of a few loci may promote adaptive divergence and so facilitate speciation. Gene regulatory networks, epigenetic effects and the evolution of selfish genetic material in the genome suggest that the Dobzhansky-Muller model of hybrid incompatibilities requires a broader interpretation. Finally, although the incidence of reinforcement remains uncertain, this and other interactions in areas of sympatry may have knock-on effects on speciation both within and outside regions of hybridization.},

Infection experiments were conducted in aposymbiotic larvae of the scleractinian Fungia scutaria using known algal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS)-2 types within Clade C. Our results show that algal type is directly related to specificity during the onset of symbiosis in F. scutaria larvae. The 3 ITS symbiont types (C1f, C15 and C31) within the major Symbiodinium Clade C engaged differentially in symbiosis with coral larvae. The homologous symbiont (C1f), found in adult F. scutaria from the field, showed a significantly better association with the host larvae than the other 2 heterologous symbionts (C15 extracted from Porites compressa, and C31 from Montipora capitata).

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hybridization, genetic mixture of distinct populations, gives rise to myriad recombinant genotypes. Characterizing the genomic composition of hybrids is critical for studies of hybrid zone dynamics, inheritance of traits, and consequences of hybridization for evolution and conservation. Hybrid genomes are often summarized either by an estimate of the proportion of alleles coming from each ancestral population or classification into discrete categories like F1, F2, backcross, or merely "hybrid" vs. "pure". In most cases, it is not realistic to classify individuals into the restricted set of classes produced in the first two generations of admixture. However, the continuous ancestry index misses an important dimension of the genotype. Joint consideration of ancestry together with interclass heterozygosity (proportion of loci with alleles from both ancestral populations) captures all of the information in the discrete classification without the unrealistic assumption that only two generations of admixture have transpired. METHODS: I describe a maximum likelihood method for joint estimation of ancestry and interclass heterozygosity. I present two worked examples illustrating the value of the approach for describing variation among hybrid populations and evaluating the validity of the assumption underlying discrete classification. RESULTS: Naively classifying natural hybrids into the standard six line cross categories can be misleading, and false classification can be a serious problem for datasets with few molecular markers. My analysis underscores previous work showing that many (50 or more) ancestry informative markers are needed to avoid erroneous classification. CONCLUSION: Although classification of hybrids might often be misleading, valuable inferences can be obtained by focusing directly on distributions of ancestry and heterozygosity. Estimating and visualizing the joint distribution of ancestry and interclass heterozygosity is an effective way to compare the genetic structure of hybrid populations and these estimates can be used in classic quantitative genetic methods for assessing additive, dominant, and epistatic genetic effects on hybrid phenotypes and fitness. The methods are implemented in a freely available package "HIest" for the R statistical software ( http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HIest/index.html).},

abstract = {Endosymbiotic dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium are fundamentally important to the biology of scleractinian corals, as well as to a variety of other marine organisms. The genus Symbiodinium is genetically and functionally diverse and the taxonomic nature of the union between Symbiodinium and corals is implicated as a key trait determining the environmental tolerance of the symbiosis. Surprisingly, the question of how Symbiodinium diversity partitions within a species across spatial scales of meters to kilometers has received little attention, but is important to understanding the intrinsic biological scope of a given coral population and adaptations to the local environment. Here we address this gap by describing the Symbiodinium ITS2 sequence assemblages recovered from colonies of the reef building coral Montipora capitata sampled across Kāne'ohe Bay, Hawai'i. A total of 52 corals were sampled in a nested design of Coral Colony(Site(Region)) reflecting spatial scales of meters to kilometers. A diversity of Symbiodinium ITS2 sequences was recovered with the majority of variance partitioning at the level of the Coral Colony. To confirm this result, the Symbiodinium ITS2 sequence diversity in six M. capitata colonies were analyzed in much greater depth with 35 to 55 clones per colony. The ITS2 sequences and quantitative composition recovered from these colonies varied significantly, indicating that each coral hosted a different assemblage of Symbiodinium. The diversity of Symbiodinium ITS2 sequence assemblages retrieved from individual colonies of M. capitata here highlights the problems inherent in interpreting multi-copy and intra-genomically variable molecular markers, and serves as a context for discussing the utility and biological relevance of assigning species names based on Symbiodinium ITS2 genotyping.},

abstract = {Animals vary in their level of site fidelity and ability (or motivation) to return to a home site when displaced. Homing behaviour may be advantageous when the costs (e.g., associated with traversing a potentially hostile landscape) are outweighed by the collective benefits (e.g., access to resources and stable social interactions) of returning to a home site. Here, we hypothesise that these costs relative to benefits - and hence, propensity to home when displaced - will vary among ontogenetic stages of a small reef fish (the common triplefin, Forsterygion lapillum) in New Zealand. We evaluated site fidelity and homing behaviour of three distinct stages (settlers, juveniles, and adults) of F. lapillum, using experimental displacements of tagged individuals. Settlers use different habitats (canopies of macroalgae) than those used by juveniles and adults (cobbles on the seafloor). To evaluate site fidelity of settlers, we constructed an array of "artificial canopies" at 5. m intervals along two parallel transects separated by 100. m of reef. We allowed fish to settle naturally to these artificial canopies, then tagged them with elastomer, and returned them to these structures (either to the same artificial canopy or else displaced to another canopy 100. m distant). After {\~{}}. 20. days, we re-captured {\~{}}. 30{\%} of tagged fish, and of these, none had returned to a home canopy when displaced (indeed, we documented no movement of tagged fish between any of the artificial canopies). We evaluated site fidelity and homing behaviour of older juveniles and adults using a separate experimental translocation of tagged individuals. For this experiment, we collected juveniles and adults from a common site, tagged them with elastomer, and either returned them to their home site or else translocated them different distances (up to 800. m) away from their home site. We found that adults were more likely to return to their home site when displaced ??? 200. m, and juveniles were more likely to remain at release locations. Overall, our results suggest that site fidelity and an ability to successfully return to a home site vary with ontogenetic stage. These findings have implications for intraspecific interactions, and indicate that local site quality may be important for adult stages of the common triplefin. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Here we address two questions arising from our previous studies of these associations on an offshore reef. First, do the same taxa and patterns of association (Symbiodinium A and B found in higher irradiance habitats than Symbiodinium C) occur on an inshore reef? Second, does M. franksi at the limits of its depth range host only Symbiodinium C, as it does at intermediate depths? In both surveys, a new Symbiodinium taxon and different patterns of distribution (assayed by analyses of small ribosomal subunit RNA genes [srDNA]) were observed. Inshore, a taxon we name Symbiodinium E predominated in higher irradiance habitats in M. franksi and its two sibling species; the only other zooxanthella observed was Symbiodinium C. Offshore, M. franksi mainly hosted Symbiodinium C, but hosted Symbiodinium A, B, C, and E in shallow water and Symbiodinium E and C in very deep water. Symbiodinium E may be stress-tolerant. Observed srDNA heterogeneity within samples of Symbiodinium B, C, and E is interpreted as variation across copies within this multigene family. Experimental bleaching of Symbiodinium C supported this interpretation. Thus sequences from natural samples should be interpreted cautiously.},

abstract = {Two widely acknowledged problems with the use of the ribosomal ITS region as a phylogenetic marker were examined in scleractinian coral: intragenomic variation and alignment ambiguities. Sequences from Caribbean and Eastern Pacific Porites and Siderastrea species were examined, as well as the nearest available outgroup sequences from GenBank (Tubastrea, Balanophyllia, Scapophyllia and Montastrea). Intragenomic variation was considerably lower than previously reported in corals, and Porites species were fully resolved. Despite a patchwork of conserved sequence motifs among all taxa, objective alignment between higher taxonomic levels became difficult as gaps and ambiguities increased. To examine the potential for the ITS region to resolve deeper level relationships, fifty alternative alignments were generated by gap-penalty permutation, and examined for consensus. The tree topologies were remarkably congruent, suggesting strong phylogenetic signal at several taxonomic levels. Alternative topologies only rarely occurred at alignment parameter extremes, therefore mid-range parameters were chosen for phylogenetic analysis. The resulting phylogeny was generally consistent with the fossil record, and with previous molecular studies while yielding higher resolution.},

abstract = {Ribosomal loci represent a major tool for investigating environmental diversity and community structure via high-throughput marker gene studies of eukaryotes (e.g. 18S rRNA). Since the estimation of species' abundance is a major goal of environmental studies (by counting numbers of sequences), understanding the patterns of rRNA copy number across species will be critical for informing such high-throughput approaches. Such knowledge is critical, given that ribosomal RNA genes exist within multi-copy repeated arrays in a genome. Here we measured the repeat copy number for six nematode species by mapping the sequences from whole genome shotgun libraries against reference sequences for their rRNA repeat. This revealed a 6-fold variation in repeat copy number amongst taxa investigated, with levels of intragenomic variation ranging from 56 to 323 copies of the rRNA array. By applying the same approach to four C. elegans mutation accumulation lines propagated by repeated bottlenecking for an average of {\~{}}400 generations, we find on average a 2-fold increase in repeat copy number (rate of increase in rRNA estimated at 0.0285-0.3414 copies per generation), suggesting that rRNA repeat copy number is subject to selection. Within each Caenorhabditis species, the majority of intragenomic variation found across the rRNA repeat was observed within gene regions (18S, 28S, 5.8S), suggesting that such intragenomic variation is not a product of selection for rRNA coding function. We find that the dramatic variation in repeat copy number among these six nematode genomes would limit the use of rRNA in estimates of organismal abundance. In addition, the unique pattern of variation within a single genome was uncorrelated with patterns of divergence between species, reflecting a strong signature of natural selection for rRNA function. A better understanding of the factors that control or affect copy number in these arrays, as well as their rates and patterns of evolution, will be critical for informing estimates of global biodiversity.},

abstract = {Rapid urban and industrial development is causing water quality deterioration in coastal marine environments. Sediment and nutrient inputs increase water turbidity, limiting light availability and reducing the photosynthetic capacity of the reef. Turbidity can also lead to organism stress, suffocation or death. Consequently, many coral reefs are declining, resulting in a loss of biodiversity and economic yield. This study investigates the relationship between water turbidity, measured as vertical attenuation of PAR (Kd), and coral and fish communities. At 35 reef sites in southwest Puerto Rico spanning a range of water turbidity, Kd was measured, and fish and coral communities were characterized. Coral and fish parameters varied with turbidity, showing higher diversities and abundances in clearer waters. Reef fishes responded to a combination of habitat characteristics. Turbidity, reef rugosity and percentage of live coral were significant variables affecting the reef fish community, and therefore are useful predictors of reef community health.},

abstract = {We present a quantitative genetic (QG) interpretation of the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM) genetic model of speciation in order to unify the theoretical framework for understanding how the genetic differentiation of populations is associated with the process of speciation. Specifically, we compare the QG theory of joint scaling with the Turelli-Orr mathematical formulation of the BDM model. By formally linking the two models, we show that a wealth of empirical methods from QG can be brought to bear on the study of the genetic architecture of hybrid phenotypes to better understand the connections, if any, between microevolution within populations and macroevolution in the origin of species. By integrating the two theories, we make additional novel predictions that enrich the opportunities for empirically testing speciation genetic theory or facets of it, such as Haldane's rule. We show that the connection between the two theories is simple and straightforward for autosomal genes but not for sex-linked genes. Differences between the two approaches highlight key conceptual issues concerning the relevance of epistasis to evolution within and among lineages and to differences in the process of speciation in hermaphrodites and in organisms with separate sexes.},

However, the endosymbiotic phase within Symbiodinium life history is inherently tied to a more cryptic free-living (ex hospite) phase that remains largely unexplored. Here we show that free-living Symbiodinium spp. in culture commonly formcalcifying bacterial–algal communities that produce aragonitic spherulites and encase the dinoflagellates as endolithic cells. This process is driven by Symbiodinium photo- synthesis but occurs only in partnership with bacteria. Our find- ings not only place dinoflagellates on the map of microbial–algal organomineralization processes but also point toward an endo- lithic phase in the Symbiodinium life history, a phenomenon that may provide new perspectives on the biology and ecology of Symbiodinium spp. and the evolutionary history of the coral– dinoflagellate symbiosis.

abstract = {The photosynthetic response to irradiance (PI response) of dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium was quantified immediately after isolation from symbiosis with 9 species of corals and allied taxa on Bermuda. Significant variation in PI parameters was identified among the algal isolates, but no consistent differences between representatives of different Symbiodinium phylotypes were obtained. In a parallel analysis of Montastraea franksi, a dominant Bermudian coral species, colonies from 4 to 16 m (all bearing Symbiodinium of Phylotype B) were acclimated to high light conditions. The photoacclimatory response was slight. It included an increase in the dark respiration rate by algae from all collection depths, increased light use efficiency and decreased saturating irradiance of algae from 4 m, and increased maximal photosynthetic rate per unit chlorophyll (chl), but not per cell, for algae from 8 and 16 m. We conclude that generalisations about differences between the photosynthetic traits between Symbiodinium phylotypes are not valid, and that the wide depth distribution of M. franksi cannot be attributed to either depth-dependent association with multiple Symbiodinium phylotypes with different photosynthetic properties or strong photoacclimatory capabilities of its complement of Symbiodinium. These data suggest that Symbiodinium phylotype is not generally an important determinant of the abundance and distribution of symbioses on coral reefs.},

abstract = {Symbiotic partnerships between heterotrophic hosts and intracellular microalgae are common in tropical and subtropical oligotrophic waters of benthic and pelagic marine habitats. The iconic
example is the photosynthetic dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium that establishes mutualistic symbioses with a wide diversity of benthic hosts, sustaining highly biodiverse reef ecosystems worldwide. Paradoxically, although various species of photosynthetic dinoflagellates are prevalent
eukaryotic symbionts in pelagic waters, Symbiodinium has not yet been reported in symbiosis within oceanic plankton, despite its high propensity for the symbiotic lifestyle. Here we report a new pelagic photosymbiosis between a calcifying ciliate host and the microalga Symbiodinium in surface ocean waters. Confocal and scanning electron microscopy, together with an 18S rDNA-based phylogeny, showed that the host is a new ciliate species closely related to Tiarina fusus (Colepidae). Phylogenetic analyses of the endosymbionts based on the 28S rDNA gene revealed multiple novel closely related Symbiodinium clade A genotypes. A haplotype network using the high-resolution internal transcribed spacer-2 marker showed that these genotypes form eight divergent, biogeographically structured, subclade types that do not seem to associate with any benthic hosts. Ecological analyses using the Tara Oceans metabarcoding data set (V9 region of the 18S rDNA) and contextual oceanographic parameters showed a global distribution of the symbiotic partnership in
nutrient-poor surface waters. The discovery of the symbiotic life of Symbiodinium in the open ocean provides new insights into the ecology and evolution of this pivotal microalga and raises new hypotheses about coastal pelagic connectivity.},

abstract = {Genetic data are rapidly advancing our understanding of various biological systems including the ecology and evolution of coral-algal symbioses. The fine-scale interactions between individual genotypes of host and symbiont remain largely unstudied and constitute a major gap in knowledge. By applying microsatellite markers developed for both host and symbiont, we investigated the intracolony diversity, prevalence and stability of Symbiodinium glynni (type D1) multilocus genotypes in association with dense populations of Pocillopora at two sites in the Gulf of California. The genetic diversity and allelic frequencies in reef populations of S. glynni remained stable over 3 years. Common clone genotypes persisted over this period, and no temporal population subdivision ($\Phi$(PT) = 0.021 and -0.003) was detected. Collections from circular plots showed no statistical correlation between related Pocillopora individuals and their associations with particular S. glynni genotypes, with no spatial structuring or clonal aggregation across a reef for the symbiont. From permanent linear transects, samples were analysed from multiple locations within a colony and some were resampled approximately 1 year later. Many of these multisampled colonies (approximately 53{\%}) were dominated by a single S. glynni genotype and tended to associate with the same symbiont genotype(s) over time, while colony ramets often possessed unrelated symbiont genotypes. In contrast to the species level, associations between genotypes of Pocillopora and S. glynni are apparently more flexible over space and time. The abundance of sexually recombinant genotypes of S. glynni combined with greater flexibility might provide adaptive mechanisms for these symbioses to evolve rapidly to changes in environmental conditions and allow particular symbiont genotypes to spread through a host population.},

Middle Reef is subjected to both local (e.g. high sediment loads) and global (e.g. coral bleaching) disturbance events, usually associated with reduced coral growth. Results indicated, however, that Acropora growth rates (mean linear extension = 6.3 cm/year) were comparable to those measured at similar depths on offshore reefs on the GBR. Montipora linear extension (2.9 cm/year) was greater than estimates available from both clear-water and turbid reefs, and Turbinaria's dense skeleton (1.3 g/cm 3) may be more resilient to physical damage as ocean pH falls. Coral growth was found to vary between reef habitats due to spatial differences in water motion and sediment dynamics, and temporally with lower calcification rates during the summer months when SSTs (monthly average 29 ??C) and rainfall (monthly total {\textgreater}500 mm) were high. In summary, corals on Middle Reef are robust and resilient to their marginal environmental conditions, but are susceptible to anthropogenic disturbances during the summer months. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Foraminifera are commonly defined as marine testate protists, and their diversity is mainly assessed on the basis of the morphology of their agglutinated or mineralized tests. Diversity surveys based on environmental DNA (eDNA) have dramatically changed this view by revealing an unexpected diversity of naked and organic-walled lineages as well as detecting foraminiferal lineages in soil and freshwater environments. Moreover, single-cell analyses have allowed discrimination among genetically distinctive types within almost every described morphospecies. In view of these studies, the foraminiferal diversity appeared to be largely underestimated, but its accurate estimation was impeded by the low speed and coverage of a cloning-based eDNA approach. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies, these limitations disappeared in favor of exhaustive descriptions of foraminiferal diversity in numerous samples. Yet, the biases and errors identified in early HTS studies raised some questions about the accuracy of HTS data and their biological interpretation. Among the most controversial issues affecting the reliability of HTS diversity estimates are (1) the impact of technical and biological biases, (2) the sensitivity and specificity of taxonomic sequence assignment, (3) the ability to distinguish rare species, and (4) the quantitative interpretation of HTS data. Here, we document the lessons learned from previous HTS surveys and present the current advances and applications focusing on foraminiferal eDNA. We discuss the problems associated with HTS approaches and predict the future trends and avenues that hold promises for surveying foraminiferal diversity accurately and efficiently.{\$}\backslash{\$}n},

abstract = {Caribbean corals of the Montastraea annularis species complex associate with four taxa of symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae; genus Symbiodinium) in ecologically predictable patterns. To investigate the resilience of these host-zooxanthella associations, we conducted field experiments in which we experimentally reduced the numbers of zooxanthellae (by transplanting to shallow water or by shading) and then allowed treated corals to recover. When depletion was not extreme, recovering corals generally contained the same types of zooxanthellae as they did prior to treatment. After severe depletion, however, recovering corals were always repopulated by zooxanthellae atypical for their habitat (and in some cases atypical for the coral species). These unusual zooxanthellar associations were often (but not always) established in experimentally bleached tissues even when adjacent tissues were untreated. Atypical zooxanthellae were also observed in bleached tissues of unmanipulated Montastraea with yellow-blotch disease. In colonies where unusual associations were established, the original taxa of zooxanthellae were not detected even 9 months after the end of treatment. These observations suggest that zooxanthellae in Montastraea range from fugitive opportunists and stress-tolerant generalists (Symbiodinium A and E) to narrowly adapted specialists (Symbiodinium B and C), and may undergo succession.},

abstract = {Alignments of two multiple-sequence alignments, or statistical models of such alignments (profiles), have important applications in computational biology. The increased amount of information in a profile versus a single sequence can lead to more accurate alignments and more sensitive homolog detection in database searches. Several profile-profile alignment methods have been proposed and have been shown to improve sensitivity and alignment quality compared with sequence-sequence methods (such as BLAST) and profile-sequence methods (e.g. PSI-BLAST). Here we present a new approach to profile-profile alignment we call Comparison of Alignments by Constructing Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (COACH). COACH aligns two multiple sequence alignments by constructing a profile HMM from one alignment and aligning the other to that HMM.},

abstract = {A new statistical method for estimating divergence dates of species from DNA sequence data by a molecular clock approach is developed. This method takes into account effectively the information contained in a set of DNA sequence data. The molecular clock of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was calibrated by setting the date of divergence between primates and ungulates at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (65 million years ago), when the extinction of dinosaurs occurred. A generalized least-squares method was applied in fitting a model to mtDNA sequence data, and the clock gave dates of 92.3 +/- 11.7, 13.3 +/- 1.5, 10.9 +/- 1.2, 3.7 +/- 0.6, and 2.7 +/- 0.6 million years ago (where the second of each pair of numbers is the standard deviation) for the separation of mouse, gibbon, orangutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee, respectively, from the line leading to humans. Although there is some uncertainty in the clock, this dating may pose a problem for the widely believed hypothesis that the pipedal creature Australopithecus afarensis, which lived some 3.7 million years ago at Laetoli in Tanzania and at Hadar in Ethiopia, was ancestral to man and evolved after the human-ape splitting. Another likelier possibility is that mtDNA was transferred through hybridization between a proto-human and a proto-chimpanzee after the former had developed bipedalism.},

abstract = {The Aiptasia-Symbiodinium symbiosis is a promising model for experimental studies of cnidarian-dinoflagellate associations, yet relatively little is known regarding the genetic diversity of either symbiotic partner. To address this, we collected Aiptasia from 16 localities throughout the world and examined the genetic diversity of both anemones and their endosymbionts. Based on newly developed SCAR markers, Aiptasia consisted of two genetically distinct populations: one Aiptasia lineage from Florida and a second network of Aiptasia genotypes found at other localities. These populations did not conform to the distributions of described Aiptasia species, suggesting that taxonomic re-evaluation is needed in the light of molecular genetics. Associations with Symbiodinium further demonstrated the distinctions among Aiptasia populations. According to 18S RFLP, ITS2-DGGE and microsatellite flanker region sequencing, Florida anemones engaged in diverse symbioses predominantly with members of Symbiodinium Clades A and B, but also C, whereas anemones from elsewhere harboured only S. minutum within Clade B. Symbiodinium minutum apparently does not form a stable symbiosis with other hosts, which implies a highly specific symbiosis. Fine-scale differences among S. minutum populations were quantified using six microsatellite loci. Populations of S. minutum had low genotypic diversity and high clonality (R = 0.14). Furthermore, minimal population structure was observed among regions and ocean basins, due to allele and genotype sharing. The lack of genetic structure and low genotypic diversity suggest recent vectoring of Aiptasia and S. minutum across localities. This first ever molecular-genetic study of a globally distributed cnidarian and its Symbiodinium assemblages reveals host-symbiont specificity and widely distributed populations in an important model system.},

abstract = {The "symbiosome membrane" as defined by Roth et al. (1988) is a single, host-derived membrane that surrounds an endosymbiotic organism, separating it from the cytoplasm of the host cell. However, in the case of cnidarian-dinoflagellate endosymbioses, clear identification of the symbiosome membrane is complicated by the fact that each algal symbiont is surrounded by multiple layers of apparent membrane. The origin and molecular nature of these membranes has been the subject of considerable debate in the literature. Here we report the development of host-specific (G12) and symbiont-specific (PC3) monoclonal antibodies that allow separation of the host and symbiont components of these multiple membranes. Using immunocytochemistry at both the light and the electron microscopic level, we present data supporting the conclusion that the definitive symbiosome membrane is a single, host-derived membrane, whereas the remainder of the underlying apparent membranes surrounding the algal cell are symbiont-derived. The potential for macromolecules associated with these membranes to act as cellular signals critical to recruiting symbionts and maintaining established symbioses is discussed.},

In this paper, we review the mathematical extensions and heuristics that move the method from the theoretical to the practical.

Finally it is demonstrated on the SH2 domain how a domain can be found from unaligned sequences using a special model type.

abstract = {Mass coral bleaching events caused by elevated seawater temperatures have resulted in extensive coral mortality throughout the tropics over the past few decades. With continued global warming, bleaching events are predicted to increase in frequency and severity, causing up to 60{\%} coral mortality globally within the next few decades. Although some corals are able to recover and to survive bleaching, the mechanisms underlying such resilience are poorly understood. Here we show that the coral host has a significant role in recovery and resilience. Bleached and recovering Montipora capitata (branching) corals met more than 100{\%} of their daily metabolic energy requirements by markedly increasing their feeding rates and CHAR (per cent contribution of heterotrophically acquired carbon to daily animal respiration), whereas Porites compressa (branching) and Porites lobata (mounding) corals did not. These findings suggest that coral species with high-CHAR capability during bleaching and recovery, irrespective of morphology, will be more resilient to bleaching events over the long term, could become the dominant coral species on reefs, and may help to safeguard affected reefs from potential local and global extinction.},

abstract = {Marine invertebrates representing at least five phyla are symbiotic with dinoflagellates from the genus Symbiodinium. This group of single-celled protists was once considered to be a single pandemic species, Symbiodinium microadriaticum. Molecular investigations over the past 25 years have revealed, however, that Symbiodinium is a diverse group of organisms with at least eight (A-H) divergent clades that in turn contain multiple molecular subclade types. The diversity within this genus may subsequently determine the response of corals to normal and stressful conditions, leading to the proposal that the symbiosis may impart unusually rapid adaptation to environmental change by the metazoan host. These questions have added importance due to the critical challenges that corals and the reefs they build face as a consequence of current rapid climate change. This review outlines our current understanding of the diverse genus Symbiodinium and explores the ability of this genus and its symbioses to adapt to rapid environmental change. ?? 2006 R??bel Foundation, ETH Z??rich.},

Fusion of the endosymbionts and their nuclei occurred concomitantly with syngamy of the host gametes. Significant morphological changes, including condensation of chromatin and crystalline rod formation, occurred in the symbiont nucleus during zygote development. These observations provide evidence that the endosymbiotic nucleus is not passive in sexual processes, as opposed to its reported passive state during mitosis. P. balticum may not only represent an intermediate in the evolution of chloroplast acquisition by dinoflagellates, but also, an intermediate in the evolution of the peridinian dinoflagellate sexual life history.},

The existence of two Symbiodinium species is substantiated by sequence analysis of the variable regions V1, V2, and V3 of the SSUrDNA, which also establishes their phylogenetic relatedness to other members of the genus Symbiodinium. Anemones from Washington and Oregon harbor a single dinoflagellate species, for which we propose the name S. muscatinei sp. nov. At these northern locations, S. muscatinei either exists alone or co-occurs with the Chlorella-like green algal symbiont. Our results indicate that S. muscatinei co-occurs with a second dinoflagellate, S. californium, in mixed populations in central and southern California. We suggest that the geographic distribution of these dinoflagellates is related to the temperature cline created by latitude.},

abstract = {One of the outstanding and poorly understood examples of cooperation between species is found in corals, hydras and jellyfish that form symbioses with algae. These mutualistic algae are mostly acquired infectiously from the seawater and, according to models of virulence evolution, should be selected to parasitize their hosts. We altered algal transmission between jellyfish hosts in the laboratory to examine the potential for virulence evolution in this widespread symbiosis. In one experimental treatment, vertical transmission of algae (parent to offspring) selected for symbiont cooperation, because symbiont fitness was tied to host reproduction. In the other treatment, horizontal transmission (infectious spread) decoupled symbiont fitness from the host, potentially allowing parasitic symbionts to spread. Fitness estimates revealed a striking shift to parasitism in the horizontal treatment. The horizontally transmitted algae proliferated faster within hosts and had higher dispersal rates from hosts compared to the vertical treatment, while reducing host reproduction and growth. However, a trade-off was detected between harm caused to hosts and symbiont fitness. Virulence trade-offs have been modelled for pathogens and may be critical in stabilising 'infectious' symbioses. Our results demonstrate the dynamic nature of this symbiosis and illustrate the potential ease with which beneficial symbionts can evolve into parasites.},

We present protocols for the extraction of ecological, taxonomic and phylogenetic information frombulk samples of arthropods. The protocols combine mass trapping of arthropods, mass-PCR amplification of theCOI barcode gene, pyrosequencing and bioinformatic analysis, which together we call ‘metabarcoding'. 3. We construct seven communities of arthropods (mostly insects) and show that it is possible to recover a substantial proportion of the original taxonomic information. We further demonstrate, for the first time, that metabarcoding allows for the precise estimation of pairwise community dis- similarity (beta diversity) and within-community phylogenetic diversity (alpha diversity), despite the inevitable loss of taxonomic information inherent tometabarcoding. 4. Alpha and beta diversity metrics are the raw materials of ecology and the environmental sci- ences, facilitating assessment of the state of the environment with a broad and efficient measure of biodiversity},

The diversity of coral hosts is high in the South China Sea, but the diversity of zooxanthellae has not yet been investigated. We chose the Zhubi Coral Reef of the Nansha Islands as the region to be surveyed in the present study because it represents a typical tropical coral reef of the South China Sea and we investigated zooxanthellae diversity in 10 host scleractinian coral species using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the large subunit rRNA and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns. Pocillopora verrucosa, Acropora pelifera, Acropora millepora, Fungria fungites, Galaxea fascicularis, and Acropora pruinosa harbor Clade C, Goniastrea aspera harbors Clade D, and Acropora formosa harbors Clades D and C. Therefore, the Clade C is the dominant type in the Zhubi Coral Reef of the Nansha Islands. Furthermore, the results of the present also disprove what has been widely accepted, namely that one coral host harbors only one algal symblont. The coral-algal symbiosis is flexible, which may be an important mechanism for surviving coral bleaching. Meanwhile, on the basis of the results of the present study, we think that Symbiodinium Clade D may be more tolerant to stress than Symbiodinium Clade C.},

abstract = {Regions of rDNA are commonly used to infer phylogenetic relationships among fungal species and as DNA barcodes for identification. These regions occur in large tandem arrays, and concerted evolution is believed to reduce intragenomic variation among copies within these arrays, although some variation still might exist. Phylogenetic studies typically use consensus sequencing, which effectively conceals most intragenomic variation, but cloned sequences containing intragenomic variation are becoming prevalent in DNA databases. To understand effects of using cloned rDNA sequences in phylogenetic analyses we amplified and cloned the ITS region from pure cultures of six Laetiporus species and one Wolfiporia species (Basidiomycota, Polyporales). An average of 66 clones were selected randomly and sequenced from 21 cultures, producing a total of 1399 interpretable sequences. Significant variation (≥ 5{\%} variation in sequence similarity) was observed among ITS copies within six cultures from three species clades (L. cincinnatus, L. sp. clade J, and Wolfiporia dilatohypha) and phylogenetic analyses with the cloned sequences produced different trees relative to analyses with consensus sequences. Cloned sequences from L. cincinnatus fell into more than one species clade and numerous cloned L. cincinnatus sequences fell into entirely new clades, which if analyzed on their own most likely would be recognized as "undescribed" or "novel" taxa. The use of a 95{\%} cut off for defining operational taxonomic units (OTUs) produced seven Laetiporus OTUs with consensus ITS sequences and 20 OTUs with cloned ITS sequences. The use of cloned rDNA sequences might be problematic in fungal phylogenetic analyses, as well as in fungal bar-coding initiatives and efforts to detect fungal pathogens in environmental samples.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hybridization or divergence between sympatric sister species provides a natural laboratory to study speciation processes. The shared polymorphism in sister species may either be ancestral or derive from hybridization, and the accuracy of analytic methods used thus far to derive convincing evidence for the occurrence of present day hybridization is largely debated. RESULTS: Here we propose the application of network analysis to test for the occurrence of present day hybridization between the two species of brown algae Fucus spiralis and F. vesiculosus. Individual-centered networks were analyzed on the basis of microsatellite genotypes from North Africa to the Pacific American coast, through the North Atlantic. Two genetic distances integrating different time steps were used, the Rozenfeld (RD; based on alleles divergence) and the Shared Allele (SAD; based on alleles identity) distances. A diagnostic level of genotype divergence and clustering of individuals from each species was obtained through RD while screening for exchanges through putative hybridization was facilitated using SAD. Intermediate individuals linking both clusters on the RD network were those sampled at the limits of the sympatric zone in Northwest Iberia. CONCLUSION: These results suggesting rare hybridization were confirmed by simulation of hybrids and F2 with directed backcrosses. Comparison with the Bayesian method STRUCTURE confirmed the usefulness of both approaches and emphasized the reliability of network analysis to unravel and study hybridization.},

We examined the diversity and depth distribution of zooxanthellae in 5 morphospecies of Madracis at the Buoy I study- reef on Cura{\{}{\c{c}}{\}}ao, Netherlands Antilles. Following earlier studies, we examined length and sequence variation in the D1 and D2 domains of the nuclear rDNA, large subunit (LSU) of Madracis-associated zooxanthellae. Both RFLP and sequence comparisons showed that all 5 Madracis morphospecies host a single type of Symbiodinium belonging to phylogenetic Group B sensu Rowan. No correlation was found between zooxanthellae and habitat depth. The presence of the single, Type-B zooxanthellae in all Madracis morphospecies at Buoy I (and from 3 other biogeographic locations in the Caribbean) suggests that ‘generalist' zooxanthellae-coral associations are equally successful over a range of habitats and that adaptations to different light and nutrient regimes are not necessarily dependent on the mix of zooxanthellae types or zonation with depth, as has been shown in the well-studied Mon- tastraea annularis complex and Acropora cervicornis. A review of the current literature on zooxan- thellae diversity in scleractinians (including biogeographic sampling for some species) shows that most species appear to harbor only 1 zooxanthellae type and that the 3 types of Symbiodinium (A, B, C sensu Rowan) are found at all depths and are thus potentially always available for acquisition},

abstract = {Scleractinian corals have demonstrated the ability to shuffle their endosymbiotic dinoflagellate communities (genus Symbiodinium) during periods of acute environmental stress. This has been proposed as a mechanism of acclimation, which would be increased by a diverse and flexible association with Symbiodinium. Conventional molecular techniques used to evaluate Symbiodinium diversity lack the sensitivity to capture accurate estimates of diversity and are unable to identify genetic lineages present at background levels below 10{\%}. Next generation sequencing (NGS) offers a solution to this problem and can resolve microorganism diversity at much finer scales. Here we apply NGS to evaluate Symbiodinium diversity and host specificity in Acropora corals from contrasting regions of Western Australia. The application of 454 pyrosequencing allowed for detection of Symbiodinium operational taxonomic units (OTUs) occurring at frequencies as low as 0.001{\%}offering a 10 000-fold increase in sensitivity compared to traditional methods. All coral species from both regions were overwhelmingly dominated by a single clade C OTU (accounting for 98{\%} of all recovered sequences). Only 8.5{\%} of colonies associated with multiple clades (clades C and D, or C and G), suggesting a high level of symbiont specificity in Acropora assemblages in Western Australia. This contrasts with recent literature that have applied highly-sensitive molecular techniques and identified widespread flexibility in symbiont associations across a number of coral taxa in other geographic regions. While only 40{\%} of the OTUs were shared between regions, the dominance of a single OTU resulted in no significant difference in Symbiodinium community structure, demonstrating that the coral-algal symbiosis can remain stable across more than 15° of latitude and a range of sea surface temperature profiles. This study validates the use of NGS platforms as tools for providing fine-scale estimates of Symbiodinium diversity and can offer critical insight into the flexibility of the coral-algal symbiosis.

abstract = {Ecosystem models represent potentially powerful tools for coral reef ecosystem managers. They can provide insight into ecosystem dynamics not achievable through alternative means allowing coral reef managers to assess the potential outcome of any given management decision. One of the main limitations in the applicability of ecosystem models is that they often require detailed empirical data and this can restrict their applicability to ecosystems that are either currently well studied or have the resources available to collect the required data. This study describes the development of a coral reef ecosystem model that can be calibrated to an ecosystem with limited empirical data. Based on the assumption that coral reef ecological structure is generic across all tropical coral reefs and that the magnitude of the interactions between ecological components is reef specific, the dynamics of the ecosystem can be replicated based on limited empirical data. The model successfully replicated the dynamics of three individual reef systems including an inshore and oceanic reef within the Great Barrier Reef and a Caribbean reef system. It highlighted the importance of understanding the specific dynamics of a given reef and that a positive management intervention in one system may result in a negative outcome for another. The model was also used to assess the importance of various interactions within coral reef ecosystems. It identified the interactions between hard corals and other non-algal benthic components as being an important (but currently understudied) facet of coral reef ecology. The development of this modelling approach provides access to ecosystem modelling tools for coral reef managers previously excluded due to a lack of resources or technical expertise. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The study of reproductive isolation between populations, combined with estimates of genetic divergence, provides important insights into mechanisms of speciation. In this study, sixteen morphologically heterogeneous sympatric clones of Eunotia bilunaris sensu lato (Bacillariophyta) were brought into culture to study their phylogenetic relationships and pre- and postzygotic reproductive barriers. An ITS rDNA phylogeny was congruent with morphology and divided the clones into three groups ('slender', 'robust' and 'labile'), pointing to the presence of several species in E. bilunaris. Whereas most strains had a heterothallic mating system, four 'labile' clones displayed apomictic behaviour. A further 'labile' clone had a heterothallic mating behaviour, however, suggesting a very recent origin for apomixis. Despite high sequence divergence, hybridization occurred between clones belonging to different groups, but was 20-400 times less frequent than in intra-group matings. F1 hybrids had an intermediate morphology and were almost completely sterile; gamete formation was generally arrested in the early stages of meiosis I. The ITS divergence of 11.5-12.3{\%} between the 'robust' and 'slender' clones seems to represent an upper limit of divergence in which cell pairing, gamete formation and auxosporulation are still possible but heavily reduced, and where hybrid sterility has already evolved.},

In addition, we found strong correlations between composition and a number of environmental variables, including nutrients, pH and turbidity. A wide range of taxa responded to these environmental gradients, providing new insights into their sensitivities to natural and anthropogenic stressors.

During the bleaching treatment the dinoflagellate symbionts showed a 5.5-fold acceleration in their photosystem II (PSII) repair rate constant, demonstrating that they maintain strong metabolic capacity to clear and replace photo-damaged D1 protein at the elevated temperature and light conditions. Nevertheless, the symbionts concurrently suffered a seven-fold increase in the rate constant for PSII photo-inactivation. This rapid photo-inactivation exceeded the PSII repair capacity, therefore tipping the symbionts, and by implication the symbiosis, into net photo-inhibition. Increased photo-inactivation in hospite, rather than an inhibition of PSII repair, is the principle trigger for net photo-inhibition under bleaching conditions.},

abstract = {Coral bleaching occurs when there is a breakdown of the symbiosis between cnidarian hosts and resident Symbiodinium spp. Multiple mechanisms for the bleaching process have been identified, including apoptosis and autophagy, and most previous work has focused on the Symbiodinium cell as the initiator of the bleaching cascade. In this work we show that it is possible for host cells to initiate apoptosis that can contribute to death of the Symbiodinium cell. First we found that colchicine, which results in apoptosis in other animals, causes cell death in the model anemone Aiptasia sp. but not in cultured Symbiodinium CCMP-830 cells or in cells freshly isolated from host Aiptasia (at least within the time frame of our study). In contrast, when symbiotic Aiptasia were incubated in colchicine, cell death in the resident Symbiodinium cells was observed, suggesting a host effect on symbiont mortality. Using live-cell confocal imaging of macerated symbiotic host cell isolates, we identified a pattern where the initiation of host cell death was followed by mortality of the resident Symbiodinium cells. This same pattern was observed in symbiotic host cells that were subjected to temperature stress. This research suggests that mortality of symbionts during temperature-induced bleaching can be initiated in part by host cell apoptosis.},

Recovered glycoconjugates of three of the five species were composed of more carbohydrate than protein. The uronic acid content of three algal species that infect scyphistomae of the jellyfish Cassiopeia were higher than those of the two species that do not infect. Analyses of hydrolysates by high-performance liquid chromatography indicated that the protein components were rich in aspartic acid (asparagine), glutamic acid (glutamine), serine, glycine, leucine, and threonine and contain proline and lysine. Histidine and methionine, when present, were in low concentration. Other sugars detected were glucose and galactose and their respective amines, ribose, mannose, and fucose. Neither sialic acid nor arabinose was detected. The release of glycoconjugates by symbiotic dinoflagellates appears to be a general phenomenon. Some components of these macromolecules could serve as signals that pass between symbionts and hosts, while other components, assuming host digestion, could be a source of previously undetected essential amino acids.},

abstract = {Animal-algal endosymbioses are a dominant fea- ture of coral reefs and an enduring theme in coral reef biology. They combine heterotrophic (animal host) and autotrophic (algal symbiont) organisms into single functional units (holobionts) that con- tribute substantially to coral reef productivity. In- deed, algal symbiosis in scleractinian corals is prob- ably responsible for the existence of coral reefs as we know them (Stanley and Swart 1995). Taxonom- ically, and therefore ecologically, the hosts are bet- ter defined. Evolutionary studies are also animal-bi- ased because many hosts leave fossils. As we learn more about the algal symbionts, we approach a real understanding of these systems. A wide variety of microalgae live as endosymbionts with marine protists or invertebrate animals, either within or among host cells (reviewed in Trench 1992, 1993). The plural noun zooxanthellae de- scribes the golden-colored ones (Blank and Trench 1986, Trench 1992), which predominate on coral reefs and are therefore the subject of this minire- view. Recent studies of zooxanthella diversity have sought to establish evolutionary and ecological re- lationships, both among symbionts and between symbionts and their hosts.

The number of degraded zooxanthellae in corals taken fmm rllfferent light conditions amounted to 1 to 6{\%} a day, which was similar to the number of dividing amxanthellae. Zooxanthellae degradation takes place only at night in the connecting sheet and tentacle but both at night and during the day in the gastroderm of the mesenteries. Zooxanthellae degradation continues for about 6 h. DNA staining with DAPI (4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and light, UV and electron microscopic examinations showed that zooxanthellae under degradation lost DNA, protein of pyrenoids and lipid drops. The degraded zooxanthellae particles contained 'accumulat{\~{}}on bodies', unpacked thylakoids, starch grains and a pyrenoid starch envelope. Under starvation experirnenls the number of degraded zooxanthellae in Stylophora pistillata increased in the tissue, as did thefi {\~{}}elease.

The union between corals and clade D is thus important to management and coral conservation. Here, we review the diversity and biogeography of clade D Symbiodinium, factors linked to increasing abundances of clade D, and the benefits and drawbacks of associating with clade D for corals. We identify clade D Symbiodinium as uncommon pandemically distributed generalists found in higher abundances on reefs exposed to challenging sea surface temperatures and local stressors or with a history of bleaching. This distribution suggests that clade D Symbiodinium are mostly opportunistic endosymbionts, whereby they outcompete and replace optimal symbionts in health-compromised corals.We conclude by identifying research gaps that limit our understanding of the adaptive role clade D Symbiodinium play in corals and discuss the utility of monitoring clade D Symbiodinium as indicators of habitat degradation in coral reef ecosystems.},

abstract = {Most evolutionary tree estimation methods for DNA sequences ignore or inefficiently use the phylogenetic infor-mation contained within shared patterns of gaps. This is largely due to the computational difficulties in implementing models for insertions and deletions. A simple way to incorporate this information is to treat a gap as a fifth character (with the four nucleotides being the other four) and to incorporate it within a Markov model of nucleotide substi-tution. This idea has been dismissed in the past, since it treats a multiple-site insertion or deletion as a sequence of independent events rather than a single event. While this is true, we have found that under many circumstances it is better to incorporate gap information inadequately than to ignore it, at least for topology estimation. We propose an extension to a class of nucleotide substitution models to incorporate the gap character and show that, for data sets (both real and simulated) with short and medium gaps, these models do lead to effective use of the information contained within insertions and deletions. We also implement an ad hoc method in which the likelihood at columns containing multiple-site gaps is downweighted in order to avoid giving them undue influence. The precision of the estimated tree, assessed using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to find the posterior distribution over tree space, improves under these five-state models compared with standard methods which effectively ignore gaps.},

abstract = {Photoinhibition may constitute an energetic cost for photosynthetic organisms through damage to the photosynthetic apparatus, or by increased metabolism due to damage avoidance or repair. For several species of scleractinian corals, fluorescence techniques have revealed a significant reduction in photochemical efficiency of symbiotic dinoflagellates within coral tissue in response to excess light absorption. To date, it has been unclear whether or not photoinhibition has a negative impact on energy budgets in corals. We simultaneously quantified the effect of exposure to excessive light on net rates of photosynthesis and on fluorescence-derived photochemistry. We acclimated colonies of the reef-building coral Turbinaria mesenterina to 3 different irradiance regimes in the laboratory. The corals were then exposed to light levels up to 10 times higher than their acclimation irradiance and assayed for rates of photosynthesis and photochemical yields. Results indicated that daily costs of photoinhibition are negligible. Reduced net rates of photosynthesis in the afternoon, compared to the morning, were predominantly due to enhanced afternoon rates of dark respiration. However, photoacclimation to high light levels reduces daily energy acquisition in the long term, primarily due to decreased chlorophyll concentrations. Therefore, although changes in the photosynthetic activity of symbiotic dinoflagellates over a diurnal irradiance cycle do not cause a measurable decline in net oxygen evolution for coral colonies, repeated exposure to excessive irradiance can reduce energy acquisition per unit surface area, and hence influence the upper limit of the depth distribution of scleractinian corals.},

abstract = {EPISODES of coral bleaching resulting from dissociation of endosymbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) from host coral tissues have occurred with increasing frequency over the past decade on reefs throughout the tropics1,2. These episodes have usually been attributed to increases in sea water temperatures3–10, but the mass bleaching events that occurred throughout the Caribbean during 1987 and 1990 were not readily explained by temperature alone11,12. An additional factor that may have contributed to these bleaching episodes is ultraviolet radiation in the 280–400-nm band. At many localities where bleaching occurred in 1987 and 1990, sea conditions were described as extremely calm with exceptionally clear water13. In the absence of suspended organic and inorganic matter in the water column, higher than average intensities of ultraviolet radiation probably reached all depths within the photic zone for several consecutive months. Evidence for a possible link between ultraviolet radiation and coral bleaching has not been forthcoming2. Here we report results of a field experiment showing that, irrespective of high water temperatures, short-term (three weeks) increases in ultraviolet radiation of a magnitude possible under calm, clear water column conditions can readily induce bleaching in reef-building corals.},

Genetic studies indicate that P. damicornis larvae are produced almost exclusively parthenogenetically, and yet population genetic surveys suggest frequent sexual reproduction. Using microsatellite data from over 580 larvae from 13 colonies, we demonstrate that P. damicornis displays a mixed reproductive strategy where sexual and asexual larvae are produced simultaneously within the same colony. The majority of larvae were parthenogenetic (94{\%}), but most colonies (10 of the 13) produced a subset of their larvae sexually. Logistic regression indicates that the proportion of sexual larvae varied significantly with colony size, cycle day, and calendar day. In particular, the decrease in sexual larvae with colony size suggests that the mixed reproductive strategy changes across the life of the coral. This unique shift in reproductive strategy leads to increasingly asexual replications of successful genotypes, which (in contrast to exclusive parthenogens) have already contributed to the recombinant gene pool.},

Here, a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay is presented to accurately determine the cell densities of Symbiodinium clades C and D in the scleractinian coral Acropora millepora, which can be extended to other coral-symbiont associations in the future. The assay targets single- to low-copy genes of the actin family of both the coral host and algal symbiont. Symbiont densities are expressed as the ratio of Symbiodinium cells to each host cell (S/H ratio, error within 30{\%}), but can also be normalized to coral surface area. Greater accuracy in estimating ratios of associations involving multiple clades is achieved compared with previous real-time PCR assays based on high-copy ribosomal DNA loci (error within an order of magnitude). Healthy adult A. millepora containing {\~{}}1.4 x 10(6) zooxanthellae per cm(2) (as determined by haemocytometer counts) had S/H ratios of c. 0.15, i.e. {\~{}}15 symbiont cells per 100 host cells. In severely bleached colonies, this ratio decreased to less than 0.005. Because of its capacity to accurately determine both densities and ratios of multiple symbionts within one sample, the assay will open the door for novel research into the mechanisms of symbiont shuffling and switching.},

Using previously reported degenerate primers for SRP54, high levels of sequence variation were found at this locus across both scleractinian and octocorals. For example, pairwise sequence divergence within octocorals was 813 times greater with SRP54 than with mtDNA, and, up to 2.8{\{}{\%}{\}} pairwise sequence divergence was found in SRP54 among individuals of Pocillopora whereas no variation at all was found in mtDNA markers. This case study with the octocoral C. riisei shows that variation in SRP54 appears sufficient to address questions of phylogeography as well as systematics of closely related species.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aggregated settlement of kin larvae in sessile marine invertebrates may result in a complex array of compatible and incompatible allogeneic responses within each assemblage. Each such aggregate can, therefore, be considered as a distinct self-organizing biological entity representing adaptations that have evolved to maximize the potential benefits of gregarious settlement. However, only sparse information exists on the selective forces and ecological consequences of allogeneic coalescence. RESULTS: We studied the consequences of aggregated settlement of kin larvae of Stylophora pistillata (a Red Sea stony coral), under controlled laboratory settings. When spat came into contact, they either fused, establishing a chimera, or rejected one another. A one-year study on growth and survivorship of 544 settled S. pistillata genotypes revealed six types of biological entities: (1) Single genotypes (SG); (2) Bi-chimeras (BC); (3) Bi-rejecting genotypes (BR); (4) Tri-chimera entities (TC); (5) Three-rejecting genotypes (TR); and (6) Multi-partner entities (MP; consisting of 7.5 +/- 2.6 partners). Analysis of allorecognition responses revealed an array of effector mechanisms: real tissue fusions, transitory fusions and six other histoincompatible reactions (borderline formation, sutures, overgrowth, bleaching, rejection, and partner death), disclosing unalike onsets of ontogeny and complex modes of appearance within each aggregate. Evaluations at the entity level revealed that MP entities were the largest, especially in the first two months (compared with SG: 571{\%} in the first month and 162{\%} in the seventh month). However, at the genotype level, the SG entities were the largest and the colonies with the highest-cost-per-genotype were the TR and the MP colonies. The cost was calculated as reduced average genotype size, from 27{\%} and 12{\%} in the first month to 67{\%} and 64{\%} in the seventh month, respectively. In general, MP exhibited the highest survivorship rate (85{\%}, after one year) and SG the lowest (54{\%}). CONCLUSION: In view of the above, we suggest that the driving force behind gregarious kin settlements in Stylophora pistillata stems from gained benefits associated with the immediate and long-term increase in total size of the MP entity, whereas survivorship rates did not draw a parallel link. Furthermore, the biological organization of MP entity exhibits, simultaneously, an intricate network of rejecting and fusible interactions in a single allogeneic intimate arena, where proposed benefits surpass costs incurred by discord among founders. Above results and documentations on gregarious settlement in other marine taxa bring us to suggest that the 'group level' of kin aggregates may serve as a ubiquitous legitimate selection entity in the evolution of a sessile mode of life in marine organisms.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic tree reconstruction requires construction of a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) from sequences. Computationally, it is difficult to achieve an optimal MSA for many sequences. Moreover, even if an optimal MSA is obtained, it may not be the true MSA that reflects the evolutionary history of the underlying sequences. Therefore, errors can be introduced during MSA construction which in turn affects the subsequent phylogenetic tree construction. In order to circumvent this issue, we extend the application of the k-tuple distance to phylogenetic tree reconstruction. The k-tuple distance between two sequences is the sum of the differences in frequency, over all possible tuples of length k, between the sequences and can be estimated without MSAs. It has been traditionally used to build a fast 'guide tree' to assist the construction of MSAs. Using the 1470 simulated sets of sequences generated under different evolutionary scenarios, the neighbor-joining trees and BioNJ trees, we compared the performance of the k-tuple distance with four commonly used distance estimators including Jukes-Cantor, Kimura, F84 and Tamura-Nei. These four distance estimators fall into the category of model-based distance estimators, as each of them takes account of a specific substitution model in order to compute the distance between a pair of already aligned sequences. Results show that trees constructed from the k-tuple distance are more accurate than those from other distances most time; when the divergence between underlying sequences is high, the tree accuracy could be twice or higher using the k-tuple distance than other estimators. Furthermore, as the k-tuple distance voids the need for constructing an MSA, it can save tremendous amount of time for phylogenetic tree reconstructions when the data include a large number of sequences.},

abstract = {Laboratory and field data bearing on the adaptive bleaching hypothesis (ABH) are largely consistent with it; no data of which we are aware refute it. We generalize the ABH in light of these data and observations. The population of zooxanthellae within an organism is dynamic, the diversity of zooxanthellae is both surprising and difficult to ascertain, and field experiments demonstrate both turn-over in zooxanthella types and habitat-holobiont correlations. Dynamic change in symbiont communities, and the idea of an equi- librium or optimal community that matches the environment at a particular place and time, are concepts that underlie or emerge from much of the recent literature. The mechanism we proposed to explain responses to acute bleaching appears to operate continuously, thereby enabling the host-symbiont holo- biont to track even subtle environmental changes and respond promptly to them. These findings enhance the potential importance of the ABH in the outcomes of acute bleaching, which can (1) accelerate this process of holobiont change, and (2) change the set of possible trajectories for how symbiont communities might recover.

abstract = {Landscape genetics has seen rapid growth in number of publications since the term was coined in 2003. An extensive literature search from 1998 to 2008 using keywords associated with landscape genetics yielded 655 articles encompassing a vast array of study organisms, study designs and methodology. These publications were screened to identify 174 studies that explicitly incorporated at least one landscape variable with genetic data. We systematically reviewed this set of papers to assess taxonomic and temporal trends in: (i) geographic regions studied; (ii) types of questions addressed; (iii) molecular markers used; (iv) statistical analyses used; and (v) types and nature of spatial data used. Overall, studies have occurred in geographic regions proximal to developed countries and more commonly in terrestrial vs. aquatic habitats. Questions most often focused on effects of barriers and/or landscape variables on gene flow. The most commonly used molecular markers were microsatellites and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLPs), with AFLPs used more frequently in plants than animals. Analysis methods were dominated by Mantel and assignment tests. We also assessed differences among journals to evaluate the uniformity of reporting and publication standards. Few studies presented an explicit study design or explicit descriptions of spatial extent. While some landscape variables such as topographic relief affected most species studied, effects were not universal, and some species appeared unaffected by the landscape. Effects of habitat fragmentation were mixed, with some species altering movement paths and others unaffected. Taken together, although some generalities emerged regarding effects of specific landscape variables, results varied, thereby reinforcing the need for species-specific work. We conclude by: highlighting gaps in knowledge and methodology, providing guidelines to authors and reviewers of landscape genetics studies, and suggesting promising future directions of inquiry.},

abstract = {Reef-building corals host assemblages of symbiotic algae (Symbiodinium spp.) whose diversity and abundance may fluctuate under different conditions, potentially facilitating acclimatization to environmental change. The composition of free-living Symbiodinium in reef waters and sediments may also be environmentally labile and may influence symbiotic assemblages by mediating supply and dispersal. The magnitude and spatial scales of environmental influence over Symbiodinium composition in different reef habitat compartments are, however, not well understood. We used pyrosequencing to compare Symbiodinium in sediments, water, and ten coral species between two backreef pools in American Samoa with contrasting thermal environments. We found distinct compartmental assemblages of clades A, C, D, F, and/or G Symbiodinium types, with strong differences between pools in water, sediments, and two coral species. In the pool with higher and more variable temperatures, abundance of various clade A and C types differed compared to the other pool, while abundance of D types was lower in sediments but higher in water and in Pavona venosa, revealing an altered habitat distribution and potential linkages among compartments. The lack of between-pool effects in other coral species was due to either low overall variability (in the case of Porites) or high within-pool variability. Symbiodinium communities in water and sediment also showed within-pool structure, indicating that environmental influences may operate over multiple, small spatial scales. This work suggests that Symbiodinium composition is highly labile in reef waters, sediments, and some corals, but the underlying drivers and functional consequences of this plasticity require further testing with high spatial resolution biological and environmental sampling.},

To determine the mechanisms of temperature tolerance, we reciprocally transplanted corals between reef sites experiencing distinct temperature regimes, and tested subsequent physiological and gene expression profiles. Local acclimatization and fixed effects, such as adaptation, contributed about equally to heat tolerance and are reflected in patterns of gene expression. In less than two years, acclimatization achieves the same heat tolerance that we would expect from strong natural selection over many generations for these long-lived organisms. Our results show both short-term acclimatory and longer-term adaptive acquisition of climate resistance.

abstract = {As populations become increasingly fragmented, managers are often faced with the dilemma that intentional hybridization might save a population from inbreeding depression but it might also induce outbreeding depression. While empirical evidence for inbreeding depression is vastly greater than that for outbreeding depression, the available data suggest that risks of outbreeding, particularly in the second generation, are on par with the risks of inbreeding. Predicting the relative risks in any particular situation is complicated by variation among taxa, characters being measured, level of divergence between hybridizing populations, mating history, environmental conditions and the potential for inbreeding and outbreeding effects to be occurring simultaneously. Further work on consequences of interpopulation hybridization is sorely needed with particular emphasis on the taxonomic scope, the duration of fitness problems and the joint effects of inbreeding and outbreeding. Meanwhile, managers can minimize the risks of both inbreeding and outbreeding by using intentional hybridization only for populations clearly suffering from inbreeding depression, maximizing the genetic and adaptive similarity between populations, and testing the effects of hybridization for at least two generations whenever possible.},

abstract = {The early effects of heat stress on the photosynthesis of symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae) within the tis- sues of a reef-building coral were examined using pulse- amplitude-modulated (PAM) chlorophyll fluorescence and photorespirometry. Exposure of Stylophora pistillata to 33 and 34 °C for 4 h resulted in (1) the development of strong non-photochemical quenching (qN) of the chloro- phyll fluorescence signal, (2) marked decreases in photo- synthetic oxygen evolution, and (3) decreases in optimal quantum yield (Fv/Fm) of photosystem II (PSII). Quantum yield decreased to a greater extent on the illu- minated surfaces of coral branches than on lower (shaded) surfaces, and also when high irradiance intensi- ties were combined with elevated temperature (33 °C as opposed to 28 °C). qN collapsed in heat-stressed samples when quenching analysis was conducted in the absence of oxygen. Collectively, these observations are interpreted as the initiation of photoprotective dissipation of excess absorbed energy as heat (qN) and O2-dependent electron flow through the Mehler-Ascorbate-Peroxidase cycle (MAP-cycle) following the point at which the rate of light-driven electron transport exceeds the capacity of the Calvin cycle. Amodel for coral bleaching is proposed whereby the primary site of heat damage in S. pistillata is carboxylation within the Calvin cycle, as has been observed during heat damage in higher plants. Damage to PSII and a reduction in Fv/Fm (i.e. photoinhibition) are secondary effects following the overwhelming of pho- toprotective mechanisms by light. This secondary factor increases the effect of the primary variable, temperature. Potential restrictions of electron flow in heat-stressed zooxanthellae are discussed with respect to Calvin cycle enzymes and the unusual status of the dinoflagellate Rubisco. Significant features of our model are that (1) dam- age to PSII is not the initial step in the sequence of heat stress in zooxanthellae, and (2) light plays a key secondary role in the initiation of the bleaching phenomena.

abstract = {Hybridization between species is commonplace in plants, but is often seen as unnatural and unusual in animals. Here, I survey studies of natural interspecific hybridization in plants and a variety of animals. At least 25{\%} of plant species and 10{\%} of animal species, mostly the youngest species, are involved in hybridization and potential introgression with other species. Species in nature are often incompletely isolated for millions of years after their formation. Therefore, much evolution of eventual reproductive isolation can occur while nascent species are in gene-flow contact, in sympatry or parapatry, long after divergence begins. Although the relative importance of geographic isolation and gene flow in the origin of species is still unknown, many key processes involved in speciation, such as 'reinforcement' of post-mating isolation by the evolution of assortative mating, will have ample opportunity to occur in the presence of continuing gene flow. Today, DNA sequence data and other molecular methods are beginning to show that limited invasions of the genome are widespread, with potentially important consequences in evolutionary biology, speciation, biodiversity, and conservation.},

abstract = {Dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium are best known as endosymbionts of corals and other invertebrate as well as protist hosts, but also exist free-living in coastal environments. Despite their importance in marine ecosystems, less than 10 loci have been used to explore phylogenetic relationships in this group, and only the multi-copy nuclear ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) regions 1 and 2 have been used to characterize fine-scale genetic diversity within the nine clades (A-I) that comprise the genus. Here, we describe a three-step molecular approach focused on 1) identifying new candidate genes for phylogenetic analysis of Symbiodinium spp., 2) characterizing the phylogenetic relationship of these candidate genes from DNA samples spanning eight Symbiodinium clades (A-H), and 3) conducting in-depth phylogenetic analyses of candidate genes displaying genetic divergences equal or higher than those within the ITS-2 of Symbiodinium clade C. To this end, we used bioinformatics tools and reciprocal comparisons to identify homologous genes from 55,551 cDNA sequences representing two Symbiodinium and six additional dinoflagellate EST libraries. Of the 84 candidate genes identified, 7 Symbiodinium genes (elf2, coI, coIII, cob, calmodulin, rad24, and actin) were characterized by sequencing 23 DNA samples spanning eight Symbiodinium clades (A-H). Four genes displaying higher rates of genetic divergences than ITS-2 within clade C were selected for in-depth phylogenetic analyses, which revealed that calmodulin has limited taxonomic utility but that coI, rad24, and actin behave predictably with respect to Symbiodinium lineage C and are potential candidates as new markers for this group. The approach for targeting candidate genes described here can serve as a model for future studies aimed at identifying and testing new phylogenetically informative genes for taxa where transcriptomic and genomics data are available.},

abstract = {The effect of prolonged (9 week) nutrient enrichment on the growth and photosynthetic rates of the zooxanthellate coral Stylophora pistillata was investigated. The main questions were: (1) what is the exposure time needed to induce measurable change in growth rate? (2) which are the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus required to cause changes in these rates? (3) what is the recovery potential of the corals after the nutrient stress? For this purpose, three tanks (N, P, NP) were enriched with ammonium (N), phosphorus (P) or both nutrients (NP), respectively. A fourth tank (C) served as a control. The growth of 40 nubbins (10 in each tank) was monitored during four periods: period 1 (nutrient-poor conditions), period 2 (10 mu M NH4 and/or mu M PO4 enrichment), period 3 (20 mu M NH4 and/or 2 mu M PO4) and period 4 (nutrient-poor conditions). Period 4 was performed to study the recovery potential of corals after a nutrient stress. During period 1, growth rates remained constant in all tanks. In the P tank, growth rates declined during the two enrichment periods, with a total decrease of 60{\{}{\%}{\}} by the end of period 3. In the N tank, growth rates remained nearly constant during period 2 but decreased in period 3 (60{\{}{\%}{\}} decrease). In the NP tank, 50{\{}{\%}{\}} and 25{\{}{\%}{\}} decreases were observed during periods 2 and 3. At the end of the recovery period, a regain in growth rate was observed in the N and NP tanks (35 and 30{\{}{\%}{\}} increase, respectively, compared with the rates measured at the end of period 3) and growth rates returned to 60{\{}{\%}{\}} of the initial rates. By contrast, in the P tank, there was no regain in growth and a further decrease of 5{\{}{\%}{\}} was observed. Rates of photosynthesis were often higher during the enriched than the nutrient-poor period (up to 150{\{}{\%}{\}} increase). Corals with the highest percent increases in maximal gross photosynthetic rate (P-max(g)) had the smallest decreases in growth rate due to nutrient enrichment. In conclusion, high ammonium (20 mu M) and relatively low phosphorus concentrations (2 mu M) are required to induce a significant decrease in coral growth rate. The largest reduction was observed with both ammonium and phosphorus enrichment. The decrease in growth rate was rapid following nutrient enrichment, since a 10{\{}{\%}{\}} decrease or more could be observed after the first week of treatment.},

With the accumulating information on the molecular diversity of these groups, binomial species classification and a reassessment of species boundaries for the partners in the coral holobiont is a logical extension of this work and will help enhance the capacity for comparative research among studies. To aid in this endeavour, we review the current literature on species diversity for the three best studied partners of the coral holobiont (coral, Symbiodinium, prokaryotes) and provide suggestions for future work on systematics within these taxa. We advocate for an integrative approach to the delineation of species using both molecular genetics in combination with phenetic characters. We also suggest that an a priori set of criteria be developed for each taxonomic group as no one species concept or accompanying set of guidelines is appropriate for delineating all members of the coral holobiont.},

abstract = {Two species of the colonial green flagellate family Volvocaceae are worldwide in distribution yet exhibit contrasting species structure. Geographically disparate isolates of Gonium pectorale Mueller can interbreed while isolates of Pandorina morum Bory behave quite differently. More than 20 sexually isolated subpopulations occur within this species; these have been termed “syngens” (sensu Sonneborn). Because prezygotic barriers to mating cause intersyngen pairings to fail, breeding analyses cannot be used to estimate genetic relatedness among the syngens of P. morum. DNA comparisons provide an alternative method of assessing genetic relatedness. We compared the nucleotide sequence of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal repeat among clones of P. morum and of G. pectorale. Members of syngens of P. morum with distribution restricted to one small geographical area show great similarity. Likewise, members of any syngen of worldwide distribution show near uniformity, even those from different continents. However, the ITS sequence of each syngen differs from that of other syngens. In contrast, G. pectorale, which has an ITS region that is remarkably uniform throughout the world, appears to consist of a single syngen within North America and Europe by mating tests. The molecular data are in complete conformity with previous syngen assignment. Because the latter is based on mating affinity, with two complementary mating types per syngen, the evolution of new mating type pairs appears to be the basis of microevolution in these algae. We infer that either P. morum is a more ancient species than G. pectorale or that P. morum has a less stable genome. In either case, the biogeographic distribution of certain syngens may reflect climatological changes of the past.},

When stressed, the host can lose these algal symbionts, a phenomenon termed "bleaching." Many cnidarians host multiple types of algal symbionts within the genus Symbiodinium, and certain types of algae may be more tolerant of stress than others. We examined the effects of temperature, temperature-induced bleaching, and infection by Aspergillus sydowii, a fungal pathogen, on Symbiodinium types harbored by the sea fan Gorgonia ventalina in the Florida Keys. Symbiont type, identified on the basis of variation in small subunit nuclear ribosomal genes or large subunit chloroplast ribosomal genes, did not vary with temperature treatment or infection status. Although allelic variation based on one microsatellite locus was found among samples and reef site, it did not consistently correlate with temperature, treatment, or disease status, suggesting that the symbiont-host relationship is stable. An aberrant PCR product was found in samples collected at one site and could be used to differentiate Symbiodinium populations among sites in the Florida Keys.},

abstract = {Reef-building corals are obligate, mutualistic symbioses of heterotrophic animals and phototrophic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.). Contrary to the earlier, widely accepted belief that corals harbour only one symbiont, we found that the ecologically dominant Caribbean corals Montastraea annularis and M. faveolata can act as hosts to dynamic, multi-species communities of Symbiodinium. Composition of these communities follows gradients of environmental irradiance, implying that physiological acclimatization is not the only mechanism by which corals cope with environmental heterogeneity. The importance of this diversity was underlined by analysis of a natural episode of coral bleaching. Patterns of bleaching could be explained by the preferential elimination of a symbiont associated with low irradiance from the brightest parts of its distribution. Comparative analyses of symbionts before and after bleaching from the same corals supported this interpretation, and suggested that some corals were protected from bleaching by hosting an additional symbiont that is more tolerant of high irradiance and temperature. This 'natural experiment' suggests that temporal and spatial variability can favour the coexistence of diverse symbionts within a host, despite the potential for destabilizing competition among them.},

In many cases delimitations rely on subjective interpretations of morphological and/or DNA data.

We infer robust species boundaries in the genus Paragorgia by testing alternative delimitation hypotheses using a Bayes Factors delimitation method. We present substantial evidence rejecting the current morphological species delimitation model for the genus and infer the presence of cryptic species associated with environmental variables. We argue that the suitability limits of RAD-seq for phylogenetic inferences cannot be assessed in terms of absolute time, but are contingent on taxon-specific factors. We show that classical taxonomy can greatly benefit from integrative approaches that provide objective tests to species delimitation hypotheses. Our results lead the way for addressing further questions in marine biogeography, community ecology, population dynamics, conservation, and evolution.},

abstract = {Reef-building corals and other tropical anthozoans harbor endosymbiotic dinoflagellates. It is now recognized that the dinoflagellates are fundamental to the biology of their hosts, and their carbon and nitrogen metabolisms are linked in important ways. Unlike free living species, growth of symbiotic dinoflagellates is unbalanced and a substantial fraction of the carbon fixed daily by symbiont photosynthesis is released and used by the host for respiration and growth. Release of fixed carbon as low molecular weight compounds by freshly isolated symbiotic dinoflagellates is evoked by a factor (i.e., a chemical agent) present in a homogenate of host tissue. We have identified this "host factor" in the Hawaiian coral Pocillopora damicornis as a set of free amino acids. Synthetic amino acid mixtures, based on the measured free amino acid pools of P. damicornis tissues, not only elicit the selective release of 14C-labeled photosynthetic products from isolated symbiotic dinoflagellates but also enhance total 14CO2 fixation.},

The ability of each of 13 genetic analyses to characterize eight ecologically distinct Symbiodinium spp. was dependent on the level of conservation of the gene region targeted and the technique used. Other than differences in resolution, phylogenetic reconstructions using nuclear and organelle gene sequences were complementary and when combined produced a well-resolved phylogeny. Analysis of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacers using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting in combination with sequencing of dominant bands provided a precise method for rapidly resolving and characterizing symbionts into ecologically and evolutionarily distinct units of diversity. Single-stranded conformation polymorphisms of the nuclear ribosomal large subunit (D1/D2 domain) identified the same number of ecologically distinct Symbiodinium spp., but profiles were less distinctive. The repetitive sequencing of bacterially cloned ITS2 polymerase chain reaction amplifications generated numerous sequence variants that clustered together according to the symbiont under analysis. The phylogenetic relationships between these clusters show how intragenomic variation in the ribosomal array diverges among closely related eukaryotic genomes. The strong correlation between phylogenetically independent lineages with different ecological and physiological attributes establishes a clear basis for assigning species designations to members of the genus Symbiodinium.},

However, the comparative roles of host genetic versus environmental 37 factors in determining the composition of this symbiosis are largely unknown. Here we 38 quantify the heritability of Symbiodinium communities in two broadcast spawning 39 corals with different symbiont transmission modes: Acropora tenuis has environmental 40 acquisition, and Montipora digitata has maternal transmission. Using high throughput 41 sequencing of the ITS-2 region to characterize communities in parental colonies, 42 juveniles and eggs, we describe new Symbiodinium types in both coral species and 43 previously unknown symbiont dynamics. After one month of natural uptake in the field, 44 Symbiodinium communities associated with A. tenuis juveniles were dominated by A3, 45 C1, D1, A-type CCMP828, and D1a in proportional abundances that were conserved 46 across two years. In contrast, M. digitata eggs were predominantly characterized by 47 C15, D1, and A3. On average, host genetic influences accounted for 29{\%} of phenotypic 48 variation found in Symbiodinium communities in A. tenuis and 62{\%} in M. digitata. Our 49 results reveal hitherto unknown flexibility in the acquisition of Symbiodinium 50 communities and substantial heritability in both species provides ample material for 51 selection to produce partnerships that are locally adapted to changing environmental 52 conditions.},

abstract = {Variation in the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the rRNA (rrn) operon is increasingly used to infer population-level diversity in bacterial communities. However, intragenomic ITS variation may skew diversity estimates that do not correct for multiple rrn operons within a genome. This study characterizes variation in ITS length, tRNA composition, and intragenomic nucleotide divergence across 155 Bacteria genomes. On average, these genomes encode 4.8 rrn operons (range: 2-15) and contain 2.4 unique ITS length variants (range: 1-12) and 2.8 unique sequence variants (range: 1-12). ITS variation stems primarily from differences in tRNA gene composition, with ITS regions containing tRNA-Ala + tRNA-Ile (48{\%} of sequences), tRNA-Ala or tRNA-Ile (10{\%}), tRNA-Glu (11{\%}), other tRNAs (3{\%}), or no tRNA genes (27{\%}). Intragenomic divergence among paralogous ITS sequences grouped by tRNA composition ranges from 0{\%} to 12.11{\%} (mean: 0.94{\%}). Low divergence values indicate extensive homogenization among ITS copies. In 78{\%} of alignments, divergence is {\textless}1{\%}, with 54{\%} showing zero variation and 81{\%} containing at least two identical sequences. ITS homogenization occurs over relatively long sequence tracts, frequently spanning the entire ITS, and is largely independent of the distance (basepairs) between operons. This study underscores the potential contribution of interoperon ITS variation to bacterial microdiversity studies, as well as unequivocally demonstrates the pervasiveness of concerted evolution in the rrn gene family.},

Analyses of SSU rDNA from the plastid and the nuclear genome of these dinoflagellate species indicate that they have acquired their plastids via endosymbiosis of a haptophyte. The dinoflagellate plastid sequences appear to have undergone rapid sequence evolution, and there is considerable divergence between the three species. However, distance, parsimony, and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses of plastid SSU rRNA gene sequences place the three species within the haptophyte clade. Pavlova gyrans is the most basal branching haptophyte and is the outgroup to a clade comprising the dinoflagellate sequences and those of other haptophytes. The haptophytes themselves are thought to have plastids of a secondary origin; hence, these dinoflagellates appear to have tertiary plastids. Both molecular and morphological data divide the plastids into two groups, where G. aureolum and G. breve have similar plastid morphology and G. galatheanum has plastids with distinctive features.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The PCR-based analysis of homologous genes has become one of the most powerful approaches for species detection and identification, particularly with the recent availability of Next Generation Sequencing platforms (NGS) making it possible to identify species composition from a broad range of environmental samples. Identifying species from these samples relies on the ability to match sequences with reference barcodes for taxonomic identification. Unfortunately, most studies of environmental samples have targeted ribosomal markers, despite the fact that the mitochondrial Cytochrome c Oxidase subunit I gene (COI) is by far the most widely available sequence region in public reference libraries. This is largely because the available versatile ("universal") COI primers target the 658 barcoding region, whose size is considered too large for many NGS applications. Moreover, traditional barcoding primers are known to be poorly conserved across some taxonomic groups.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We first design a new PCR primer within the highly variable mitochondrial COI region, the "mlCOIintF" primer. We then show that this newly designed forward primer combined with the "jgHCO2198" reverse primer to target a 313 bp fragment performs well across metazoan diversity, with higher success rates than versatile primer sets traditionally used for DNA barcoding (i.e. LCO1490/HCO2198). Finally, we demonstrate how the shorter COI fragment coupled with an efficient bioinformatics pipeline can be used to characterize species diversity from environmental samples by pyrosequencing. We examine the gut contents of three species of planktivorous and benthivorous coral reef fish (family: Apogonidae and Holocentridae). After the removal of dubious COI sequences, we obtained a total of 334 prey Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) belonging to 14 phyla from 16 fish guts. Of these, 52.5{\%} matched a reference barcode ({\textgreater}98{\%} sequence similarity) and an additional 32{\%} could be assigned to a higher taxonomic level using Bayesian assignment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The molecular analysis of gut contents targeting the 313 COI fragment using the newly designed mlCOIintF primer in combination with the jgHCO2198 primer offers enormous promise for metazoan metabarcoding studies. We believe that this primer set will be a valuable asset for a range of applications from large-scale biodiversity assessments to food web studies.},

abstract = {Plant disease epidemics resulting from introduction I of exotic fungal pathogens are a well-known phenomenon. Limited resistance in the host and excessive aggressiveness in the pathogen (reflecting their lack of prior coevolution) can result in an explosive outbreak of disease. Introduction events also present a window of evolutionary opportunity for the pathogen. In its endemic location, a plant pathogen tends to be subject to routine selection constraints, favoring maintenance of a relatively stable, if fluctuating, population structure over time. When introduced into a new environment, it will often be subject to novel or episodic selection, reflecting sudden exposure to new biotic and abiotic influences, such as a new host population,:new vectors, new competitors, or a different climate. These influences provide the potential for rapid evolution (Brasier 1995). Falling within the category of episodic selection is the sudden contact that can occur between closely related but previously geographically isolated pathogens as a result of introductions. Theoretically, this process presents an opportunity for rapid emergence of new or modified pathogens via interspecific gene flow (Brasier 1995). Until recently, this phenomenon has been little studied. Now Dutch elm disease, a major ecological accident of the 20th century (Heybroek 1993), is providing remarkable insights into rapid evolution of a plant pathogen outside its endemic environment. This article describes the migratory events and unusual genetic events that have occurred in this fungus and other new examples of rapid pathogen evolution via interspecific gene now, and discusses some of the wider environmental, evolutionary, and quarantine implications.},

abstract = {The association between cnidarians and photosynthetic dinoflagellates within the genus Symbiodinium is a prevalent relationship in tropical and subtropical marine environments. Although the diversity of Symbiodinium provides a possible axis for niche diversification, increased functional range and resilience to physical stressors such as elevated temperature, how such diversity relates to the physiological balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy of the host animal remains unknown. Here we experimentally show inter- and intraspecific variability of photosynthetic carbon fixation and subsequent translocation by Symbiodinium to the model cnidarian host Aiptasia pallida. By using a clonal anemone line harboring different species of Symbiodinium, we determined that symbiont identity influences trophic plasticity through its density, capacity to fix carbon, quantity of translocated carbon, and ultimately the host's capacity to ingest and digest prey. Symbiont carbon translocation and host prey ingestion were positively correlated across symbiont combinations that consisted of different isoclonal lines of S. minutum, while a combination with type D4-5 Symbiodinium displayed lower carbon translocation, and prey capture and digestion more similar to Aiptasia lacking symbionts. The absence of a shift toward greater heterotrophy when carbon translocation is low suggests that the metabolic demand of feeding and digestion may overwhelm nutritional stores when photosynthesis is reduced, and amends the possible role of animal feeding in resistance to or recovery from the effects of climate change in more obligate symbioses such as reef building corals.},

Moreover, optimal alignment scores are less powerful than probabilistic scores that integrate over alignment uncertainty ("Forward" scores), but the expected distribution of Forward scores remains unknown. Here, I conjecture that both expected score distributions have simple, predictable forms when full probabilistic modeling methods are used. For a probabilistic model of local sequence alignment, optimal alignment bit scores ("Viterbi" scores) are Gumbel-distributed with constant lambda = log 2, and the high scoring tail of Forward scores is exponential with the same constant lambda. Simulation studies support these conjectures over a wide range of profile/sequence comparisons, using 9,318 profile-hidden Markov models from the Pfam database.

abstract = {Background and Aims Recent research on the history of Platanus reveals that hybridization phenomena occurred in the central American species. This study has two goals: to help resolve the evolutive puzzle of central American Platanus, and to test the potential of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detecting ancient hybridization. Methods Sequencing of a uniparental plastid DNA marker [psbA-trnH((GUG)) intergenic spacer] and qualitative and quantitative single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping of biparental nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) markers [LEAFY intron 2 (LFY-i2) and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2)] were used. Key Results Based on the SNP genotyping results, several Platanus accessions show the presence of hybridization/introgression, including some accessions of P. rzedowskii and of P. mexicana var. interior and one of P. mexicana var. mexicana from Oaxaca (= P. oaxacana). Based on haplotype analyses of the psbA-trnH spacer, five haplotypes were detected. The most common of these is present in taxa belonging to P. orientalis, P. racemosa sensu lato, some accessions of P. occidentalis sensu stricto (s.s.) from Texas, P. occidentalis var. palmeri, P. mexicana s.s. and P. rzedowskii. This is highly relevant to genetic relationships with the haplotypes present in P. occidentalis s.s. and P. mexicana var. interior. Conclusions Hybridization and introgression events between lineages ancestral to modern central and eastern North American Platanus species occurred. Plastid haplotypes and qualitative and quantitative SNP genotyping provide information critical for understanding the complex history of Mexican Platanus. Compared with the usual molecular techniques of sub-cloning, sequencing and genotyping, real-time PCR assay is a quick and sensitive technique for analysing complex evolutionary patterns.},

Line-cross analyses allowed us a general overview of the gene action responsible for fitness-related traits. We then used a QTL mapping approach to detect genomic regions responsible for variation in these traits. Although hybrid classes suffered reduced fitness for many traits, hybrid means were equivalent to at least one of the parental species in overall estimates of maternal and paternal fitness during the two years of the field study. The genetic architecture underlying the fitness-related traits varied across field site and year of the study, thus emphasizing the importance of the environment in determining the degree of postzygotic isolation and potential for introgression across natural hybrid zones.},

abstract = {The role of symbiont variation in the photobiol- ogy of reef corals was addressed by investigating the links among symbiont genetic diversity, function and ecological distribution in a single host species, Madracis pharensis. Symbiont distribution was studied for two depths (10 and 25 m), two diVerent light habitats (exposed and shaded) and three host colour morphs (brown, purple and green). Two Symbiodinium genotypes were present, as deWned by nuclear internal transcribed spacer 2 ribosomal DNA (ITS2-rDNA) variation. Symbiont distribution was depth- and colour morph-dependent. Type B15 occurred predomi- nantly on the deeper reef and in green and purple colonies, while type B7 was present in shallow environments and brown colonies. DiVerent light microhabitats at Wxed depths had no eVect on symbiont presence. This ecological distribution suggests that symbiont presence is potentially driven by light spectral niches. A reciprocal depth trans- plantation experiment indicated steady symbiont populations under environment change. Functional parameters such as pigment composition, chlorophyll a Xuorescence and cell densities were measured for 25 m and included in multivariate analyses. Most functional variation was explained by two photobiological assemblages that relate to either symbiont identity or light microhabitat, suggesting adaptation and acclimation, respectively. Type B15 occurs with lower cell densities and larger sizes, higher cellular pigment concentrations and higher peridinin to chlorophyll a ratio than type B7. Type B7 relates to a larger xanthophyll-pool size. These unambiguous diVerences between symbionts can explain their distributional patterns, with type B15 being potentially more adapted to darker or deeper environments than B7. Symbiont cell size may play a central role in the adaptation of coral holobionts to the deeper reef. The existence of functional diVerences between B-types shows that the clade classiWcation does not necessarily correspond to functional identity. This study supports the use of ITS2 as an ecological and functionally meaningful marker in Symbiodinium.},

@article{Coffroth2005a,
abstract = {Coral reef ecosystems, one of the most biodiverse habitats in the world, owe their success to obligate mutualistic symbioses involving invertebrates and photosynthetic di- noflagellate symbionts (Hallock 2001). These single-celled algae, commonly referred to as zooxanthellae and predominantly belonging to the genus Symbiodinium (Fig. 1), establish relationships with numerous hosts, including representatives of the Protists, Porifera, Cnidar- ia and Mollusca (Glynn 1996; Lobban et al. 2002; Rowan 1998; Trench 1993). In most cases the algae are intracellular, residing in complex host-derived vacuoles (Colley and Trench 1983; Wakefield and Kempf 2001), but some inverte- brates (e.g., bivalves in the genera Hippopus and Tridacna) harbor their symbionts intercellu- larly in an elaborate tubular system (Norton et al. 1992). Given the oligotrophic nature of waters surrounding coral reefs, it comes as no surprise that the basis of the symbiosis is nutritional, with the dinoflagellates playing a significant role in host nourishment and phy- siology (Muscatine and Porter 1977). For example, photosynthetically fixed carbon, typi- cally in the form of glycerol and other simple molecules, can be translocated from the algae at a rate and volume capable of meeting the hosts respiratory demands (Falkowski et al. 1984; Muscatine 1990; Muscatine et al. 1984). Furthermore, the presence of Symbiodinium facilitates the assimilation and conservation of nitrogen (Ambariyanto and Hoegh-Guldberg 1996; Burris 1983; Lewis and Smith 1971), a limiting resource in these ecosystems (Muller- Parker and DElia 1997; Muscatine and Porter 1977). For the scleractinian corals, whose skele- tons comprise the physical structure of reefs, the presence of algal symbionts also significantly enhances calcification rates (Barnes and Chalker 1990; Pearse and Muscatine 1971). While vertical (closed system) transmission, in which Symbiodinium is passed directly from parent to progeny, is common, a vast majority of invertebrates (85{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}; Schwarz et al. 2002) produce offspring that must be infected from environmental pools of Symbiodinium (horizon- tal, or open system, transmission). Given the more-or-less obligate nature of Symbiodinium invertebrate symbioses (exceptions do exist; for example, some anemones, such as Aiptasia sp., can prosper without their symbionts when alternative sources of nutrition are available), it is surprising that horizontal transmission of algae to each new host generation is so prevalent. However, horizontal transmission potentially offers host progeny an opportunity to associate with Symbiodinium better adapted to local environmental conditions (van Oppen 2004). This hypothesis assumes functional and, by extension, genetic diversity exists within the genus Symbiodinium. But until the advent of culturing techniques, electron microscopy and molecular analyses, there was scant evidence supporting this assumption.},

We report here on the analysis of a high-quality assembly from the 1180-megabase genome of Symbiodinium kawagutii. We annotated protein-coding genes and identified Symbiodinium-specific gene families. No whole-genome duplication was observed, but instead we found active (retro)transposition and gene family expansion, especially in processes important for successful symbiosis with corals. We also documented genes potentially governing sexual reproduction and cyst formation, novel promoter elements, and a microRNA system potentially regulating gene expression in both symbiont and coral. We found biochemical complementarity between genomes of S. kawagutii and the anthozoan Acropora, indicative of host-symbiont coevolution, providing a resource for studying the molecular basis and evolution of coral symbiosis.},

abstract = {Symbiotic associations between invertebrates and dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium are a common occurrence in marine environments. However, despite our extensive knowledge concerning the physiological contributions of these algae to their symbiotic partners, our understanding of zooxanthella phylogenetics is still in its early stages. In the past 10 years, studies of Symbiodinium phylogenetics have relied solely on nuclear ribosomal (rDNA) genes. To date, organellar DNA sequences have not been employed to infer phylogenies for this genus of symbiotic dinoflagellates. We address this by presenting the first Symbiodinium phylogeny based on chloroplast (cp) large subunit (23S)-rDNA sequences. Cp23S-rDNA Domain V sequences were determined for 35 dinoflagellate cultures isolated from a range of invertebrate host species and geographical locations. Symbiodinium phylogenies inferred from cp23S-rDNA produced topologies that were not statistically different from those generated from nuclear rDNA, providing the first independent evidence supporting the published major clades of Symbiodinium. In addition, comparisons of sequence dissimilarity indicated that cp23S-rDNA Domain V evolves 9-30 times faster than the V1-V4 regions of nuclear small subunit (n18S)-rDNA, 1-7 times as fast as the D1-D3 regions of nuclear large subunit (n28S)-rDNA, and 0.27-2.25 times that of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-rDNA region. Our data suggested that cp23S-rDNA Domain V will prove to be a useful molecule for exploring Symbiodinium phylogenetics.},

The genetic identity of Symbiodinium from six coral species [Acropora palmata (Lamarck), A. cervicornis (Lamarck), Siderastrea siderea (Ellis and Solander), Montastrea faveolata (Ellis and Solander), M. annularis (Ellis and Solander), and M. franksi (Gregory)] was examined seasonally over five years (1998 and 2000-2004) in the Bahamas and Florida Keys at shallow (1 to 4 m) fore-reef/patch reef sites and at deeper fore-reef (12-15 m) locations. Symbionts were identified genetically using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting of the internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2) of ribosomal RNA gene loci. Repetitive sampling from most labeled colonies from the Bahamas and the Florida Keys showed little to no change in their dominant symbiont. In contrast, certain colonies of M. annularis and M. franksi from the Florida Keys exhibited shifts in their associations attributed to recovery from the stresses of the 1997-1998 El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO) event. Over several years, a putatively stress-tolerant clade D type of Symbiodinium was progressively replaced in these colonies by symbionts typically found in M. annularis and M. franksi in Florida and at other Caribbean locations. Greater environmental fluctuations in Florida may explain the observed changes among some of the symbioses. Furthermore, symbiotic associations were more heterogeneous at shallow sites, relative to deep sites. The exposure to greater environmental variability near the surface may explain the higher symbiont diversity found within and between host colonies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: the analysis of microbial communities through dna sequencing brings many challenges: the integration of different types of data with methods from ecology, genetics, phylogenetics, multivariate statistics, visualization and testing. With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast UniFrac, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of the materials necessary to completely reproduce the analysis and figures included in this article, an example of best practices for reproducible research.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The phyloseq project for R is a new open-source software package, freely available on the web from both GitHub and Bioconductor.},

The possibility of primary outbreaks being linked to terrestrial runoff has been postulated a number of times, suggesting that enhanced nutrient supply is critical for enhanced A. planci larval development. This paper examines the evidence for such a cause, focussing particularly on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Nutrient discharges from rivers have increased at least four-fold in the central GBR over the last century, and concentrations of large phyto-plankton ({\textgreater}2 $\mu$m) of the inshore central GBR shelf in the wet season when A. planci larvae develop, is double that of other places and times. Larval development, growth and survival increase almost ten-fold with doubled concentrations of large phyto-plankton. This and other lines of evidence suggest that frequent A. planci outbreaks on the GBR may indeed be a result of increased nutrient delivery from the land.},

abstract = {Abstract:  Although nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats evolve together through concerted evolution, some genomes contain a considerable diversity of paralogous rDNA. This diversity includes not only multiple functional loci but also putative pseudogenes and recombinants. We examined the occurrence of divergent paralogues and recombinants in Gossypium, Nicotiana, Tripsacum, Winteraceae, and Zea ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. Some of the divergent paralogues are probably rDNA pseudogenes, since they have low predicted secondary structure stability, high substitution rates, and many deamination-driven substitutions at methylation sites. Under standard PCR conditions, the low stability paralogues amplified well, while many high-stability paralogues amplified poorly. Under highly denaturing PCR conditions (i.e., with dimethylsulfoxide), both low- and high-stability paralogues amplified well. We also found recombination between divergent paralogues. For phylogenetics, divergent ribosomal paralogues can aid in reconstructing ancestral states and thus serve as good outgroups. Divergent paralogues can also provide companion rDNA phylogenies. However, phylogeneticists must discriminate among families of divergent paralogues and recombinants or suffer from muddled and inaccurate organismal phylogenies.},

abstract = {The diversity and community structures of symbiotic dinoflagellates are described from reef invertebrates in southern and central provinces of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, and Zamami Island, Okinawa, Japan. The symbiont assemblages from region to region were dominated by Clade C Symbiodinium spp. and consisted of numerous host-specific and/or rare types (specialists), and several types common to many hosts (generalists). Prevalence in the host community among certain host-generalist symbionts differed between inshore and offshore environments, across latitudinal (central versus southern GBR) gradients, and over wide geographic ranges (GBR versus Okinawa). One particular symbiont (C3h) from the GBR had a dramatic shift in dominance. Its prevalence ranged from being extremely rare, or absent on high-latitude reefs to dominating the scleractinian diversity on a mid-latitude inshore reef. These changes occurred among coral fauna whose larvae must acquire symbionts from environmental sources (horizontal symbiont acquisition). Such differences did not occur among 'vertical transmitters' such as Porites spp., Montipora spp. and pocilloporids (corals that directly transmit symbionts to their offspring) or among those hosts displaying 'horizontal acquisition', but that associate with specific symbionts. Most host-specialized types were found to be characteristic of a particular geographic region (i.e. Okinawa versus Central GBR versus Southern GBR). The mode of symbiont acquisition may play an important role in how symbiont composition may shift in west Pacific host communities in response to climate change. There is no indication that recent episodes of mass bleaching have provoked changes in host-symbiont combinations from the central GBR.},

abstract = {5S RNA genes and their nontranscribed spacers are tandemly repeated in plant genomes at one or more chromosomal loci. To facilitate an understanding of the forces that govern 5S rDNA evolution, copy-number estimation and DNA sequencing were conducted for a phylogenetically well-characterized set of 16 diploid species of cotton (Gossypium) and 4 species representing allopolyploid derivatives of the diploids. Copy number varies over twentyfold in the genus, from approximately 1,000 to 20,000 copies/2C genome. When superimposed on the organismal phylogeny, these data reveal examples of both array expansion and contraction. Across species, a mean of 12{\%} of nucleotide positions are polymorphic within individual arrays, for both gene and spacer sequences. This shows, in conjunction with phylogenetic evidence for ancestral polymorphisms that survive speciation events, that intralocus concerted evolutionary forces are relatively weak and that the rate of interrepeat homogenization is approximately equal to the rate of speciation. Evidence presented also shows that duplicated 5S rDNA arrays in allopolyploids have retained their subgenomic identity since polyploid formation, thereby indicating that interlocus concerted evolution has not been an important factor in the evolution of these arrays. A descriptive model, one which incorporates the opposing forces of mutation and homogenization within a selective framework, is outlined to account for the empirical data presented. Weak homogenizing forces allow equivalent levels of sequence polymorphism to accumulate in the 5S gene and spacer sequences, but fixation of mutations is nearly prohibited in the 5S gene. As a consequence, fixed interspecific differences are statistically underrepresented for 5S genes. This result explains the apparent paradox that despite similar levels of gene and spacer diversity, phylogenetic analysis of spacer sequences yields highly resolved trees, whereas analyses based on 5S gene sequences do not.},

abstract = {Understanding the potential for coral adaptation to warming seas is complicated by interactions between symbiotic partners that define stress responses and the difficulties of tracking selection in natural populations. To overcome these challenges, we characterised the contribution of both animal host and symbiotic algae to thermal tolerance in corals that have already experienced considerable warming on par with end-of-century projections for most coral reefs. Thermal responses in Platygyra daedalea corals from the hot Persian Gulf where summer temperatures reach 36°C were compared with conspecifics from the milder Sea of Oman. Persian Gulf corals had higher rates of survival at elevated temperatures (33 and 36°C) in both the non-symbiotic larval stage (32-49{\{}{\%}{\}} higher) and the symbiotic adult life-stage (51{\{}{\%}{\}} higher). Additionally, Persian Gulf hosts had fixed greater potential to mitigate oxidative stress (31-49{\{}{\%}{\}} higher) and their Symbiodinium partners had better retention of photosynthetic performance under elevated temperature (up to 161{\{}{\%}{\}} higher). Superior thermal tolerance of Persian Gulf versus Sea of Oman corals was maintained after 6-months acclimatisation to a common ambient environment and was underpinned by genetic divergence in both the coral host and symbiotic algae. In P. daedalea host samples, genome-wide SNP variation clustered into two discrete groups corresponding with Persian Gulf and Sea of Oman sites. Symbiodinium within host tissues predominantly belonged to ITS2 rDNA type C3 in the Persian Gulf and type D1a in the Sea of Oman contradicting patterns of Symbiodinium thermal tolerance from other regions. Our findings provide evidence that genetic adaptation of both host and Symbiodinium has enabled corals to cope with extreme temperatures in the Persian Gulf. Thus, the persistence of coral populations under continued warming will likely be determined by evolutionary rates in both, rather than single, symbiotic partners.

abstract = {The chloroplast genes of dinoflagellates are distributed among small, circular dsDNA molecules termed minicircles. In this paper, we describe the structure of the non-coding region of the psbA minicircle from Symbiodinium. DNA sequence was obtained from five Symbiodinium strains obtained from four different coral host species (Goniopora tenuidens, Heliofungia actiniformis, Leptastrea purpurea and Pocillopora damicornis), which had previously been determined to be closely related using LSU rDNA region D1/D2 sequence analysis. Eight distinct sequence blocks, consisting of four conserved cores interspersed with two metastable regions and flanked by two variable regions, occurred at similar positions in all strains. Inverted repeats (IRs) occurred in tandem or  twin' formation within two of the four cores. The metastable regions also consisted of twin IRs and had modular behaviour, being either fully present or completely absent in the different strains. These twin IRs are similar in sequence to double-hairpin elements (DHEs) found in the mitochondrial genomes of some fungi, and may be mobile elements or may serve a functional role in recombination or replication. Within the central unit (consisting of the cores plus the metastable regions), all IRs contained perfect sequence inverses, implying they are highly evolved. IRs were also present outside the central unit but these were imperfect and possessed by individual strains only. A central adenine-rich sequence most closely resembled one in the centre of the non-coding part of Amphidinium operculatum minicircles, and is a potential origin of replication. Sequence polymorphism was extremely high in the variable regions, suggesting that these regions may be useful for distinguishing strains that cannot be differentiated using molecular markers currently available for Symbiodinium.},

The focus of this paper is on the role of diversity within functional groups in securing important ecosystem processes that contribute to the resilience of coral-dominated reef states. Two important components of species biodiversity that confer ecosystem resilience are analyzed: redundancy and the diversity of responses within functional groups to change. Three critical functional groups are used to illustrate the interaction between these two components and their role in coral reef resilience: zooxanthellae (symbiotic micro algae in reef-building corals), reef-building corals, and herbivores. The paper further examines the consequences of undermining functional redundancy and response diversity and addresses strategies to secure ecological processes that are critical for coral reef resilience.},

Offspring of migrants therefore may experience heterosis and have higher fitness than resident individuals. This will, in turn, result in the immigrant alleles being present in higher frequencies than predicted from neutral expectations and thus a higher effective migration rate. In this paper we derive a formula to calculate the effective migration rate in the presence of heterosis. It is shown that the effect of heterosis on the migration rate can be substantial when fitness reduction within local populations is severe. The effect will be more pronounced in species with relatively short map lengths. Furthermore the heterosis effect will be highly variable throughout the genome, with the largest effect seen near selected genes and in regions of high gene density.},

abstract = {We have found that human and ape ribosomal genes undergo concerted evolution involving genetic exchanges among nucleolus organizers on nonhomologous chromosomes. This conclusion is based upon restriction enzyme analysis of the ribosomal gene families in man and five ape species. Certain structural features were found to differ among (but not within) species even though the ribosomal genes have a multichromosomal distribution. Genetic exchanges among nucleolus organizer regions may be related to the well-known phenomenon of acrocentric chromosome associations observed in man and apes. Length variation in a region of the nontranscribed spacer was found in both chimpanzee species we examined. The nature of this length variation was found to be identical to that previously described in man. The origin of the length variation and its polymorphism within these three species might be explained by unequal alignment and unequal cross-over among the ribosomal genes. An especially surprising finding was a nucleotide sequence polymorphism present in each individual human and ape we examined. Some ribosomal genes of each individual have a HindII site in the 28S gene about 800 base pairs from the EcoRI site in this gene. The remaining 28S genes lack this HindII site. The presence of this polymorphism within individuals of every species we examined suggests that it has been maintained by natural selection.},

abstract = {Symbioses are widespread in nature and occur along a continuum from parasitism to mutualism. Coral-dinoflagellate symbioses are defined as mutualistic because both partners receive benefit from the association via the exchange of nutrients. This successful interaction underpins the growth and formation of coral reefs. The symbiotic dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium is genetically diverse containing eight divergent lineages (clades A-H). Corals predominantly associate with clade C Symbiodinium and to a lesser extent with clades A, B, D, F, and G. Variation in the function and interactive physiology of different coral-dinoflagellate assemblages is virtually unexplored but is an important consideration when developing the contextual framework of factors that contribute to coral reef resilience. In this study, we present evidence that clade A Symbiodinium are functionally less beneficial to corals than the dominant clade C Symbiodinium and may represent parasitic rather than mutualistic symbionts. Our hypothesis is supported by (i) a significant correlation between the presence of Symbiodinium clade A and health-compromised coral; (ii) a phylogeny and genetic diversity within Symbiodinium that suggests a different evolutionary trajectory for clade A compared with the other dominant Symbiodinium lineages; and (iii) a significantly lower amount of carbon fixed and released by clade A in the presence of a coral synthetic host factor as compared with the dominant coral symbiont lineage, clade C. Collectively, these data suggest that along the symbiotic continuum the interaction between clade A Symbiodinium and corals may be closer to parasitism than mutualism.},

abstract = {Profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs) and probabilistic inference methods have made important contributions to the theory of sequence database homology search. However, practical use of profile HMM methods has been hindered by the computational expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an acceleration heuristic for profile HMMs, the "multiple segment Viterbi" (MSV) algorithm. The MSV algorithm computes an optimal sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped vector-parallel approach previously described for fast Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a 20-fold acceleration of the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward algorithms using a method I call "sparse rescaling". These methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full HMM Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is implemented in the freely available HMMER3 software package. Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic MSV filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to unaccelerated profile HMM searches. HMMER3 is substantially more sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than HMMER2. HMMER3 is now about as fast as BLAST for protein searches.},

abstract = {The lack of a consensus bacterial species concept greatly hampers our ability to understand and organize bacterial diversity. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which are clustered on the basis of DNA sequence identity alone, are the most commonly used microbial diversity unit. Although it is understood that OTUs can be phylogenetically incoherent, the degree and the extent of the phylogenetic inconsistency have not been explicitly studied. Here, we tested the phylogenetic signal of OTUs in a broad range of bacterial genera from various phyla. Strikingly, we found that very few OTUs were monophyletic, and many showed evidence of multiple independent origins. Using previously established bacterial habitats as benchmarks, we showed that OTUs frequently spanned multiple ecological habitats. We demonstrated that ecological heterogeneity within OTUs is caused by their phylogenetic inconsistency, and not merely due to 'lumping' of taxa resulting from using relaxed identity cut-offs. We argue that ecotypes, as described by the Stable Ecotype Model, are phylogenetically and ecologically more consistent than OTUs and therefore could serve as an alternative unit for bacterial diversity studies. In addition, we introduce QuickES, a new wrapper program for the Ecotype Simulation algorithm, which is capable of demarcating ecotypes in data sets with tens of thousands of sequences.},

Using pulse-chase (15)N labeling and quantitative ion microprobe isotopic imaging (NanoSIMS; nanoscale secondary-ion mass spectrometry), we visualized these dynamic processes in tissues of the symbiotic coral Pocillopora damicornis at the subcellular level.

abstract = {Coral reefs worldwide are in decline. Much of the mortality can be attributed to coral bleaching (loss of the coral's intracellular photosynthetic algal symbiont) associated with global warming. How corals will respond to increasing oceanic temperatures has been an area of extensive study and debate. Recovery after a bleaching event is dependent on regaining symbionts, but the source of repopulating symbionts is poorly understood. Possibilities include recovery from the proliferation of endogenous symbionts or recovery by uptake of exogenous stress-tolerant symbionts.},

abstract = {In this paper, I utilise the CO2 (sink) limitation model of coral bleaching to propose a new biochemical framework that explains how certain (well-adapted) coral species can utilise heterotrophic carbon acquisition to combat the damaging algal photoinhibition response sequence that underpins thermal bleaching, thereby increasing thermal bleaching resistance. This mechanistic linkage helps to clarify a number of previously challenging experimental responses arising from feeding (versus starved) temperature stress experiments, and isotope labelling (tracer) experiments with heterotrophic carbon sources (e.g., zooplankton). In an era of rapidly warming surface ocean temperatures, the conferred fitness benefits arising from such a mechanistic linkage are considerable. Yet, various ecological constraints are outlined which caution against the ultimate benefit of the mechanism for raising bleaching thresholds at the coral community (reef) scale. Future experiments are suggested that can strengthen these proposed arguments.},

abstract = {In landscape genetics, isolation-by-distance (IBD) is regarded as a baseline pattern that is obtained without additional effects of landscape elements on gene flow. However, the configuration of suitable habitat patches determines deme topology, which in turn should affect rates of gene flow. IBD patterns can be characterized either by monotonically increasing pairwise genetic differentiation (for example, FST) with increasing interdeme geographic distance (case-I pattern) or by monotonically increasing pairwise genetic differentiation up to a certain geographical distance beyond which no correlation is detectable anymore (case-IV pattern). We investigated if landscape configuration influenced the rate at which a case-IV pattern changed to a case-I pattern. We also determined at what interdeme distance the highest correlation was measured between genetic differentiation and geographic distance and whether this distance corresponded to the maximum migration distance. We set up a population genetic simulation study and assessed the development of IBD patterns for several habitat configurations and maximum migration distances. We show that the rate and likelihood of the transition of case-IV to case-I FST-distance relationships was strongly influenced by habitat configuration and maximum migration distance. We also found that the maximum correlation between genetic differentiation and geographic distance was not related to the maximum migration distance and was measured across all deme pairs in a case-I pattern and, for a case-IV pattern, at the distance where the FST-distance curve flattens out. We argue that in landscape genetics, separate analyses should be performed to either assess IBD or the landscape effects on gene flow.Heredity advance online publication, 23 July 2014; doi:10.1038/hdy.2014.62.},

Obtaining accurate alignments, however, is a difficult computational problem because of not only the high computational cost but also the lack of proper objective functions for measuring alignment quality.

We present ProbCons, a practical tool for progressive protein multiple sequence alignment based on probabilistic consistency, and evaluate its performance on several standard alignment benchmark data sets. On the BAliBASE, SABmark, and PREFAB benchmark alignment databases, ProbCons achieves statistically significant improvement over other leading methods while maintaining practical speed.

abstract = {Traditional real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction protocols cannot be used accurately with symbiotic organisms unless the relative contribution of each symbiotic compartment to the total nucleic acid pool is known. A modified 'universal reference gene' protocol was created for reef-building corals and sea anemones, anthozoans that harbour endosymbiotic dinoflagellates belonging to the genus Symbiodinium. Gene expression values are first normalized to an RNA spike and then to a symbiont molecular proxy that represents the number of Symbiodinium cells extracted and present in the RNA. The latter is quantified using the number of genome copies of heat shock protein-70 (HSP70) amplified in the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Gene expression values are then normalized to the total concentration of RNA to account for differences in the amount of live tissue extracted among experimental treatments and replicates. The molecular quantification of symbiont cells and effect of increasing symbiont contributions to the nucleic acid pool on gene expression were tested in vivo using differentially infected sea anemones Aiptasia pulchella. This protocol has broad application to researchers who seek to measure gene expression in mixed organism assemblages.},

abstract = {We analyzed small subunit ribosomal rRNA gene (SSU rDNA) in single-cell isolated strains of ‘‘Alexandrium tamarense'', ‘‘Alexandrium fundyense'' and ‘‘Alexandrium catenella'' (Atama complex) by both direct and clone-based sequencing, and found 42–50 intragenomic SSU rDNA polymorphic sites (High IRP) in some of the strains but none or one (No/Low IRP) in others. Clone sequencing of the High- IRP amplicons revealed numerous variants with 0–3.5{\%} nucleotide differences. Phylogenetic analyses including reported and new Atama complex SSU rDNA data divided this complex into two major well- separated clades. All the High-IRP sequences obtained in this study were grouped in Clade I (High-IRP clade), which also contained strains of Atama complex previously reported from northern Asia. Clade II (No/Low-IRP clade), with no evidence of IRP except for the one polymorphic site found in one of the strains, contained a subclade (IIC) exclusively of ‘‘A. catenella'' from various geographic locations and several other subclades (IIA, IIB) predominantly of ‘‘A. tamarense''. Clade I corresponded to Group I in the large subunit (LSU) rDNA-based phylogenetic tree (Lilly et al., 2007), and subclades in our Clade II corresponded to the LSU-based Groups II–V. Our IRP information further unites the many seemingly different genotypes into a coherent group (Clade I) and provides delineating boundary between this and other genotypes (Clade II) in Atama complex. Based on the currently available data, we propose that Clade I and subclade IIC represent two distinct species, while the rest of Clade II represents another one or more species. Clade I should be considered one species because (1) intragenomic rDNA variants dispersed across strains in the phylogenetic tree uniting the many different genotypes to same or closely related populations, (2) their expressed SSU rDNAs (i.e. rRNAs) are almost identical (1 out of 1700 nt, 0.06{\%} difference), and (3) the corresponding Group I in the LSU-based tree also appears to be a coherent group. Subclade IIC should be considered another species because it has a long distance from the rest of Clade II as well as Clade I. Whether the rest of Clade II (mainly European ‘‘A. tamarense'' subclades) represents another one or more species requires further study. Our results show that the three original morphospecies designations are invalid, and the strains do not group based on geographic locations or whether they are toxic in general, although some subclades are predominated by part of a morphotype from a region. Applying the IRP-guided analysis to a toxic Alexandrium bloom in Long Island Sound revealed that although some undocumented Alexandrium-related and other dinoflagellate lineages co- existed, the majority of the ‘‘diverse'' SSU sequences detected belonged to one single population identical to ‘‘A. fundyense'' in Gulf of Maine. Our result suggests that negligence of IRP could lead to incorrect recognition of the intragenomic SSU rDNA variants as distinct genotypes, thus overestimating strain diversity diversity of a bloom of this species complex and possibly other HAB lineages},

abstract = {The ability to predict gene content is highly desirable for characterization of not-yet sequenced genomes like those of dinoflagellates. Using data from completely sequenced and annotated genomes from phylogenetically diverse lineages, we investigated the relationship between gene content and genome size using regression analyses. Distinct relationships between log(10)-transformed protein-coding gene number (Y') versus log(10)-transformed genome size (X', genome size in kbp) were found for eukaryotes and non-eukaryotes. Eukaryotes best fit a logarithmic model, Y' = ln(-46.200+22.678X', whereas non-eukaryotes a linear model, Y' = 0.045+0.977X', both with high significance (p{\textless}0.001, R(2){\textgreater}0.91). Total gene number shows similar trends in both groups to their respective protein coding regressions. The distinct correlations reflect lower and decreasing gene-coding percentages as genome size increases in eukaryotes (82{\%}-1{\%}) compared to higher and relatively stable percentages in prokaryotes and viruses (97{\%}-47{\%}). The eukaryotic regression models project that the smallest dinoflagellate genome (3x10(6) kbp) contains 38,188 protein-coding (40,086 total) genes and the largest (245x10(6) kbp) 87,688 protein-coding (92,013 total) genes, corresponding to 1.8{\%} and 0.05{\%} gene-coding percentages. These estimates do not likely represent extraordinarily high functional diversity of the encoded proteome but rather highly redundant genomes as evidenced by high gene copy numbers documented for various dinoflagellate species.},

abstract = {Dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium form important symbioses within corals and other benthic marine animals. Dinoflagellates possess an extremely reduced plastid genome relative to those examined in plants and other algae. In dinoflagellates the plastid genes are located on small plasmids, commonly referred to as 'minicircles'. However, the chloroplast genomes of dinoflagellates have only been extensively characterised from a handful of species. There is also evidence of considerable variation in the chloroplast genome organisation across those species that have been examined. We therefore characterised the chloroplast genome from an environmental coral isolate, in this case containing a symbiont belonging to the Symbiodinium sp. clade C3. The gene content of the genome is well conserved with respect to previously characterised genomes. However, unlike previously characterised dinoflagellate chloroplast genomes we did not identify any 'empty' minicircles. The sequences of this chloroplast genome show a high rate of evolution relative to other algal species. Particularly notable was a surprisingly high level of sequence divergence within the core polypeptides of photosystem I, the reasons for which are currently unknown. This chloroplast genome also possesses distinctive codon usage and GC content. These features suggest that chloroplast genomes in Symbiodinium are highly plastic.},

In this study, the effects of bleaching (induced by elevated light and temperature) on the condition of symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium sp.) within the tissue of the hard coral Stylophora pistillata (Esper) were assessed using a suite of techniques. Bleaching of S. pistillata was accompanied by declines in the maximum potential quantum yield of photosynthesis (Fv/Fm, measured using pulse amplitude modulated PAM fluorometry), an increase in the number of Sytox-green-stained algae (indicating compromised algal membrane integrity and cell death), an increase in 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluroscein diacetate (H2DCFDA)- stained algae (indicating increased oxidative stress), as well as ultrastructural changes (vacuolisation, losses of chlorophyll, and an increase in accumulation bodies). Algae expelled from S. pistillata exhibited a complete disorganisation of cellular contents; expelled cells contained only amorphous material. In situ samples taken during a natural mass coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef in February 2002 also revealed a high number of Sytox-labelled algae cells in symbio. Dinoflagellate degeneration during bleaching seems to be similar to the changes resulting from senescence-phase cell death in cultured algae. These data support a role for oxidative stress in the mechanism of coral bleaching and highlight the importance of algal degeneration during the bleaching of a reef coral.},

abstract = {All reef-building corals are obligately associated with photosynthetic microalgal endosymbionts called zooxanthellae. Zooxanthella taxonomy has emphasized differences between species of hosts, but the possibility of ecologically significant zooxanthella diversity within hosts has been the subject of speculation for decades. Analysis of two dominant Caribbean corals showed that each associates with three taxa of zooxanthellae that exhibit zonation with depth--the primary environmental gradient for light-dependent marine organisms. Some colonies apparently host two taxa of symbionts in proportions that can vary across the colony. This common occurrence of polymorphic, habitat-specific symbioses challenges conventional understanding of the units of biodiversity but also illuminates many distinctive aspects of marine animal-algal associations. Habitat specificity provides ecological explanations for the previously documented poor concordance between host and symbiont phylogenies and the otherwise surprising lack of direct, maternal transmission of symbionts in many species of hosts. Polymorphic symbioses may underlie the conspicuous and enigmatic variability characteristic of responses to environmental stress (e.g., coral "bleaching") and contribute importantly to the phenomenon of photoadaptation.},

Their interactions with plants sometimes benefit and sometimes act to the detriment of humans. Many fungi establish ecologically vital mutualisms, such as in mycorrhizal fungi that enhance nutrient acquisition, and endophytes that combat insects and other herbivores. Other fungi and many oomycetes are plant pathogens that devastate natural and agricultural populations of plant species. Studies of fungal and oomycete evolution were extraordinarily difficult until the advent of molecular phylogenetics. Over the past decade, researchers applying these new tools to fungi and oomycetes have made astounding new discoveries, among which is the potential for interspecific hybridization. Consequences of hybridization among pathogens include adaptation to new niches such as new host species, and increased or decreased virulence. Hybrid mutualists may also be better adapted to new hosts and can provide greater or more diverse benefits to host plants.},

abstract = {Applications that require resequencing of hundreds or thousands of predefined genomic regions in numerous samples are common in studies of non-model organisms. However few approaches at the scale intermediate between multiplex PCR and sequence capture methods are available. Here we explored the utility of Molecular Inversion Probes (MIPs) for the medium-scale targeted resequencing in a non-model system. Markers targeting 112 bp of exonic sequence were designed from transcriptome of Lissotriton newts. We assessed performance of 248 MIP markers in a sample of 85 individuals. Among the 234 (94.4{\%}) successfully amplified markers 80{\%} had median coverage within one order of magnitude, indicating relatively uniform performance; coverage uniformity across individuals was also high. In the analysis of polymorphism and segregation within family, 77{\%} of 248 tested MIPs were confirmed as single copy Mendelian markers. Genotyping concordance assessed using replicate samples exceeded 99{\%}. MIP markers for targeted resequencing have a number of advantages: high specificity, high multiplexing level, low sample requirement, straightforward laboratory protocol, no need for preparation of genomic libraries and no ascertainment bias. We conclude that MIP markers provide an effective solution for resequencing targets of tens or hundreds of kb in any organism and in a large number of samples.},

abstract = {The continuous decline in Earth's biodiversity represents a major crisis and challenge for the 21st century, and there is international political agreement to slow down or halt this decline. The challenge is in large part impeded by the lack of knowledge on the state and distribution of biodiversity - especially since the majority of species on Earth are un-described by science. All conservation efforts to save biodiversity essentially depend on the monitoring of species and populations to obtain reliable distribution patterns and population size estimates. Such monitoring has traditionally relied on physical identification of species by visual surveys and counting of individuals. However, traditional monitoring techniques remain problematic due to difficulties associated with correct identification of cryptic species or juvenile life stages, a continuous decline in taxonomic expertise, non-standardized sampling, and the invasive nature of some survey techniques. Hence, there is urgent need for alternative and efficient techniques for large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA (eDNA) - defined here as: genetic material obtained directly from environmental samples (soil, sediment, water, etc.) without any obvious signs of biological source material - is an efficient, non-invasive and easy-to-standardize sampling approach. Coupled with sensitive, cost-efficient and ever-advancing DNA sequencing technology, it may be an appropriate candidate for the challenge of biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA has been obtained from ancient as well as modern samples and encompasses single species detection to analyses of ecosystems. The research on eDNA initiated in microbiology, recognizing that culture-based methods grossly misrepresent the microbial diversity in nature. Subsequently, as a method to assess the diversity of macro-organismal communities, eDNA was first analyzed in sediments, revealing DNA from extinct and extant animals and plants, but has since been obtained from various terrestrial and aquatic environmental samples. Results from eDNA approaches have provided valuable insights to the study of ancient environments and proven useful for monitoring contemporary biodiversity in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In the future, we expect the eDNA-based approaches to move from single-marker analyses of species or communities to meta-genomic surveys of entire ecosystems to predict spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns. Such advances have applications for a range of biological, geological and environmental sciences. Here we review the achievements gained through analyses of eDNA from macro-organisms in a conservation context, and discuss its potential advantages and limitations for biodiversity monitoring.},

abstract = {The question we address in this article is how hybridization in the recent past can be detected in recently evolved species. Such species may not have evolved genetic incompatibilities and may hybridize with little or no fitness loss. Hybridization can be recognized by relatively small genetic differences between sympatric populations because sympatric populations have the opportunity to interbreed whereas allopatric populations do not. Using microsatellite DNA data from Darwin's finches in the Galapagos archipelago, we compare sympatric and allopatric genetic distances in pairs of Geospiza and Camarhynchus species. In agreement with the hybridization hypothesis, we found a statistically strong tendency for a species to be more similar genetically to a sympatric relative than to allopatric populations of that relative. Hybridization has been studied directly on two islands, but it is evidently more widespread in the archipelago. We argue that introgressive hybridization may have been a persistent feature of the adaptive radiation through most of its history, facilitating evolutionary diversification and occasionally affecting both the speed and direction of evolution.},

abstract = {The success of coral reefs is due to obligate mutualistic symbioses involving invertebrates and photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbionts belonging to the genus Symbiodinium. In the Caribbean, the vast majority of octocorals and other invertebrate hosts associate with Symbiodinium clade B, and more selectively, with a single lineage of this clade, Symbiodinium B1/B184. Although B1/B184 represents the most prevalent Symbiodinium in the Caribbean, there is little evidence supporting fine-scale diversity and host-alga specificity within this lineage. We explored simultaneously the questions of diversity and specificity in Symbiodinium B1/B184 by sequencing the flanking regions of two polymorphic microsatellites from a series of Symbiodinium clade B cultures along with Symbiodinium B1/B184 populations of the octocorals Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae, P. bipinnata and Gorgonia ventalina. Seven unique sequence variants were identified based on concatenation of the two loci. Phylogenetic analyses of these variants, which we refer to as phylotypes, recognized five as belonging to B1/B184, thus providing the first evidence of distinct taxa within this Symbiodinium lineage. Furthermore, sympatric P. elisabethae and P. bipinnata at San Salvador in the Bahamas were found to harbour distinct Symbiodinium B1/B184 phylotypes, demonstrating unequivocally the existence of fine-scale specificity between Caribbean octocorals and these algae. Taken together, this study exemplifies the complex nature of Symbiodinium biodiversity and specificity.},

abstract = {The symbiosis between reef-building corals and their algal endosymbionts (zooxanthellae of the genus Symbiodinium) is highly sensitive to temperature stress, which makes coral reefs vulnerable to climate change. Thermal tolerance in corals is known to be substantially linked to the type of zooxanthellae they harbour and, when multiple types are present, the relative abundance of types can be experimentally manipulated to increase the thermal limits of individual corals. Although the potential exists for this to translate into substantial thermal acclimatization of coral communities, to date there is no evidence to show that this takes place under natural conditions. In this study, we show field evidence of a dramatic change in the symbiont community of Acropora millepora, a common and widespread Indo-Pacific hard coral species, after a natural bleaching event in early 2006 in the Keppel Islands (Great Barrier Reef). Before bleaching, 93.5{\%} (n=460) of the randomly sampled and tagged colonies predominantly harboured the thermally sensitive Symbiodinium type C2, while the remainder harboured a tolerant Symbiodinium type belonging to clade D or mixtures of C2 and D. After bleaching, 71{\%} of the surviving tagged colonies that were initially C2 predominant changed to D or C1 predominance. Colonies that were originally C2 predominant suffered high mortality (37{\%}) compared with D-predominant colonies (8{\%}). We estimate that just over 18{\%} of the original A. millepora population survived unchanged leaving 29{\%} of the population C2 and 71{\%} D or C1 predominant six months after the bleaching event. This change in the symbiont community structure, while it persists, is likely to have substantially increased the thermal tolerance of this coral population. Understanding the processes that underpin the temporal changes in symbiont communities is key to assessing the acclimatization potential of reef corals.},

abstract = {Statisticians most often use the linear mixed model to analyze Gaussian longitudinal data. The value and familiarity of the R2 statistic in the linear univariate model naturally creates great interest in extending it to the linear mixed model. We define and describe how to compute a model R2 statistic for the linear mixed model by using only a single model. The proposed R2 statistic measures multivariate association between the repeated outcomes and the fixed effects in the linear mixed model. The R2 statistic arises as a 1–1 function of an appropriate F statistic for testing all fixed effects (except typically the intercept) in a full model. The statistic compares the full model to a null model with all fixed effects deleted (except typically the intercept) while retaining exactly the same covariance structure. Furthermore, the R2 statistic leads immediately to a natural definition of a partial R2 statistic. A mixed model in which ethnicity gives a very small p- value as a longitudinal predictor of blood pressure compellingly illustrates the value of the statistic. In sharp contrast to the extreme p-value, a very small R2, a measure of statistical and scientific importance, indicates that ethnicity has an almost negligible association with the repeated blood pressure outcomes for the study.},

abstract = {Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (T-RFLP) was used to track the changes of bacterial community compositions (BCC) in coastal surface sediments along an environmental pollution gradient between 2004 and 2006. BCC in the chronically contaminated sites showed the largest deviation from those in the adjacent sites. Surprisingly, BCC at two contrasting environments (oceanic vs. river-influenced) were more similar. Unexpectedly, the BCC did not recover (when compared to oceanic control site) even after 5 years of pollution abatement initiatives in Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong. On the other hand, disposal of treated sewage for 5 years in one of the sites did not significantly affect the BCC. A striking seasonal variation in the BCC was observed at only the polluted sites. Although factors other than pollution gradients may explain the observed BCC patterns, the information presented here can be useful in predicting long-term effects of pollution on BCC. Furthermore, this study suggests that BCC analysis using T-RFLP is a faster, reliable and easier approach to monitor microbenthic community response to environmental pollution gradient in coastal sediments. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

These reefs are tightly woven ecosystems with complex linkages, which, if disturbed, result in an unpleasant chain of events. Furthermore, these reefs are the main source of animal protein for more than a billion people. Aside from supplying food, they stabilize shorelines and protect the land from rising seas and storm damage. Also, they provide sources of medicines used for bone grafts and treatment for certain viruses. However, these reefs are in danger of being permanently damaged as a result of natural and man-made forces. In response to this threat, most marine scientists have suggested that local communities be involved in the implementation and management of programs, with the aim of achieving sustainable reef maintenance. In addition, international agencies have taken the initiative to finance such programs to ensure their continuity. Overall, the management and development of coastal ecosystems depend on how they are managed and not on how they are being exploited.

abstract = {Sexual life cycle events in Pfiesteria piscicida and cryptoperidiniopsoid heterotrophic dinoflagellates were determined by following the development of isolated gamete pairs in single-drop microcultures with cryptophyte prey. Under these conditions, the observed sequence of zygote formation, develop- ment, and postzygotic divisions was similar in these dinoflagellates. Fusion of motile gamete pairs each produced a rapidly swimming uninucleate plano- zygote with two longitudinal flagella. Planozygotes enlarged as they fed repeatedly on cryptophytes. In o12h in most cases, each planozygote formed a transparent-walled nonmotile cell (cyst) with a sin- gle nucleus. Zygotic cysts did not exhibit dormancy under these conditions. In each taxon, dramatic swirling chromosome movements (nuclear cyclosis) were found in zygote nuclei before division. In P.piscicida, nuclear cyclosis occurred in the zygotic cyst or apparently earlier in the planozygote. In the cryptoperidiniopsoids, nuclear cyclosis occurred in the zygotic cyst. After nuclear cyclosis, a single cell division occurred in P. piscicida and crypt- operidiniopsoid zygotic cysts, producing two off- spring that emerged as biflagellated cells. These two flagellated cells typically swam for hours and fed on cryptophytes before encysting. A single cell divi- sion in these cysts produced two biflagellated off- spring that also fed before encysting for further reproduction. This sequence of zygote development and postzygotic divisions typically was completed within 24h and was confirmed in examples from different isolates of each taxon. Some aspects of the P. piscicida sexual life cycle determined here dif- fered from previous reports. Key},

abstract = {The ecological success of shallow-water reef-building corals (Hexacorallia: Scleractinia) is framed by their intimate endosymbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium (zooxanthellae). In contrast, the closely related black corals (Hexacorallia: Anthipatharia) are described as azooxanthellate (lacking Symbiodinium), a trait thought to reflect their preference for low-light environments that do not support photosynthesis. We examined 14 antipatharian species collected between 10 and 396 m from Hawai'i and Johnston Atoll for the presence of Symbiodinium using molecular typing and histology. Symbiodinium internal transcribed spacer-2 (ITS-2) region sequences were retrieved from 43 per cent of the antipatharian samples and 71 per cent of the examined species, and across the entire depth range. The ITS-2 sequences were identical or very similar to those commonly found in shallow-water scleractinian corals throughout the Pacific. Histological analyses revealed low densities of Symbiodinium cells inside antipatharian gastrodermal tissues (0-92 cells mm(-3)), suggesting that the Symbiodinium are endosymbiotic. These findings confirm that the capacity to engage in endosymbiosis with Symbiodinium is evolutionarily conserved across the cnidarian subclass Hexacorallia, and that antipatharians associate with Symbiodinium types found in shallow-water scleractinians. This study represents the deepest record for Symbiodinium to date, and suggests that some members of this dinoflagellate genus have extremely diverse habitat preferences and broad environmental ranges.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The algal endosymbionts (genus Symbiodinium) associated with scleractinian corals (and other reef invertebrates) have received a lot of research attention in the past decade, particularly as certain host-symbiont associations appear more affected by increasing seawater temperatures than others. With the rapid accumulation of information on the diversity of Symbiodinium, it is becoming increasingly difficult to compare newly acquired Symbiodinium data with existing data to detect patterns of host-symbiont specificity on broader spatial scales. The lack of a general consensus on the classification of Symbiodinium species coupled with the variety of different markers used to identify the genus Symbiodinium (ITS1, ITS2, LSU D1/D2, chloroplast 23S rDNA and psbA minicircle) further complicate direct comparison. DESCRIPTION: The SymbioGBR database compiles all currently available Symbiodinium sequences and associated host information of data collected from the Great Barrier Reef into a single relational database that is accessible via a user-friendly, searchable web-based application (http://www.SymbioGBR.org). SymbioGBR allows users to query Symbiodinium types or sequences sourced from various genetic markers (e.g. ITS1, ITS2, LSU D1/D2 and chloroplast 23S) and invertebrate host species to explore their reported associations. In addition, as the database includes sequence information of multiple genetic markers, it allows cross-referencing between conventional (e.g. ITS2 region) and novel markers that exhibit low intragenomic variability (e.g. psbA region). Finally, the database is based on the collection details of individual specimens. Such host-symbiont associations can be assessed quantitatively and viewed in relation to their environmental and geographic context. CONCLUSIONS: The SymbioGBR database provides a comprehensive overview of Symbiodinium diversity and host-associations on the Great Barrier Reef. It provides a quick, user-friendly means to compare newly acquired data on Symbiodinium (e.g. raw sequences or characterized Symbiodinium types) with previous data on the diversity of invertebrate host-symbiont associations on the GBR. The inclusion of psbAncr sequence information allows for validation of widely used ITS1/ITS2 markers and their ability to accurately identify relevant sequences. Most importantly, centralization of sequence information from multiple genetic markers will aid the classification of Symbiodinium species diversity and allow researchers to easily compare patterns of host-Symbiodinium associations.},

abstract = {Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a co-factor of DNA polymerases delta and epsilon, is essential for DNA replication and repair. Understanding the structure and expression characteristics of this gene in dinoflagellates would enable us to gain insights into how the cell cycle in these enigmatic eukaryotes is regulated and whether this gene can be a growth marker of these ecologically important organisms. We analyzed pcna and its encoded protein from Pfiesteria piscicida (Ppi{\_}PCNA). Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and RNA ligase mediated-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE) methods, Ppi{\_}pcna cDNA was isolated; it contained a coding region for 258 amino acid residues (aa) preceded by various 5'- and 3'-untranslated ends. The deduced protein length was similar to that of typical vertebrate and plant PCNA. PCR using genomic DNA as the template yielded multiple products whose sequences revealed multiple copies of pcna in tandem repeats separated by an unknown sequence. Using real-time PCR, we estimated 41+/-7 copies of this gene in each P. piscicida cell. Reverse transcription real-time PCR indicated a similar pcna mRNA level between the exponential and the stationary growth phases. Western blot analysis revealed a slightly higher PCNA level ({\textless}2-fold) in the exponential than in the stationary growth phases. We conclude that (1) P. piscicida possesses a typical eukaryote PCNA; (2) unlike in other eukaryotes, pcna in P. piscicida occurs in multiple copies arranged in tandem; and (3) regulation of P. piscicida PCNA probably lies in post-translational modification.},

abstract = {Hybridization may influence evolution in a variety of ways. If hybrids are less fit, the geographical range of ecologically divergent populations may be limited, and prezygotic reproductive isolation may be reinforced. If some hybrid genotypes are fitter than one or both parents, at least in some environments, then hybridization could make a positive contribution. Single alleles that are at an advantage in the alternative environment and genetic background will introgress readily, although such introgression may be hard to detect. 'Hybrid speciation', in which fit combinations of alleles are established, is more problematic; its likelihood depends on how divergent populations meet, and on the structure of epistasis. These issues are illustrated using Fisher's model of stabilizing selection on multiple traits, under which reproductive isolation evolves as a side-effect of adaptation in allopatry. This confirms a priori arguments that while recombinant hybrids are less fit on average, some gene combinations may be fitter than the parents, even in the parental environment. Fisher's model does predict heterosis in diploid F1s, asymmetric incompatibility in reciprocal backcrosses, and (when dominance is included) Haldane's Rule. However, heterosis arises only when traits are additive, whereas the latter two patterns require dominance. Moreover, because adaptation is via substitutions of small effect, Fisher's model does not generate the strong effects of single chromosome regions often observed in species crosses.},

abstract = {Dinoflagellate chloroplast genes are unique in that each gene is on a separate minicircular chromosome. To understand the origin and evolution of this exceptional genomic organization we completely sequenced chloroplast psbA and 23S rRNA gene minicircles from four dinoflagellates: three closely related Heterocapsa species (H. pygmaea, H. rotundata, and H. niei) and the very distantly related Amphidinium carterae. We also completely sequenced a Protoceratium reticulatum minicircle with a 23S rRNA gene of novel structure. Comparison of these minicircles with those previously sequenced from H. triquetra and A. operculatum shows that in addition to the single gene all have noncoding regions of approximately a kilobase, which are likely to include a replication origin, promoter, and perhaps segregation sequences. The noncoding regions always have a high potential for folding into hairpins and loops. In all six dinoflagellate strains for which multiple minicircles are fully sequenced, parts of the noncoding regions, designated cores, are almost identical between the psbA and 23S rRNA minicircles, but the remainder is very different. There are two, three, or four cores per circle, sometimes highly related in sequence, but no sequence identity is detectable between cores of different species, even within one genus. This contrast between very high core conservation within a species, but none among species, indicates that cores are diverging relatively rapidly in a concerted manner. This is the first well-established case of concerted evolution of noncoding regions on numerous separate chromosomes. It differs from concerted evolution among tandemly repeated spacers between rRNA genes, and that of inverted repeats in plant chloroplast genomes, in involving only the noncoding DNA cores. We present two models for the origin of chloroplast gene minicircles in dinoflagellates from a typical ancestral multigenic chloroplast genome. Both involve substantial genomic reduction and gene transfer to the nucleus. One assumes differential gene deletion within a multicopy population of the resulting oligogenic circles. The other postulates active transposition of putative replicon origins and formation of minicircles by homologous recombination between them.},

abstract = {Many corals (stony corals and octocorals) rely on their symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) for survival. Under stress, zooxanthellae are expelled, resulting in coral bleaching. The hypothesis that corals may survive climate change by exchanging algal types is shown here to be potentially applicable only to a minority of corals. Data on 442 coral species from 43 studies reveal that only a few coral species may be able to change their symbionts. The ability to change symbionts seems to be linked to whether a coral species can host multiple zooxanthella clades, either at different depths on the same reef, on different reefs or at different geographic locations, or concurrently within the same colony. The combined data set shows that only 23{\{}{\%}{\}} of coral species host multiple zooxanthella clades. Most coral species (77{\{}{\%}{\}}) exhibit fidelity to a narrow subset of a single zooxanthella clade, some even to specific algal genotypes within a clade, These specific algal genotypes in coral species hosting a single algal clade do not change over time. Furthermore, no algal change occurs when a coral colony is either transplanted to different environments, or subjected to stressors such as disease or increased temperatures. For the majority of corals, therefore, algal switching does not appear to occur. These coral species will survive only if the existing host-symbiont combination withstands the changing conditions. If climate warming continues, coral reefs may undergo a change in biodiversity such that only a subset of symbiotic corals may persist.},

abstract = {Even before the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species, the perception of evolutionary change has been a tree-like pattern of diversification - with divergent branches spreading further and further from the trunk. In the only illustration of Darwin's treatise, branches large and small never reconnect. However, it is now evident that this view does not adequately encompass the richness of evolutionary pattern and process. Instead, the evolution of species from microbes to mammals builds like a web that crosses and re-crosses through genetic exchange, even as it grows outward from a point of origin. Some of the avenues for genetic exchange, for example introgression through sexual recombination versus lateral gene transfer mediated by transposable elements, are based on definably different molecular mechanisms. However, even such widely different genetic processes may result in similar effects on adaptations (either new or transferred), genome evolution, population genetics, and the evolutionary/ecological trajectory of organisms. For example, the evolution of novel adaptations (resulting from lateral gene transfer) leading to the flea-borne, deadly, causative agent of plague from a rarely-fatal, orally-transmitted, bacterial species is quite similar to the adaptations accrued from natural hybridization between annual sunflower species resulting in the formation of several new species. Thus, more and more data indicate that evolution has resulted in lineages consisting of mosaics of genes derived from different ancestors. It is therefore becoming increasingly clear that the tree is an inadequate metaphor of evolutionary change. In this book, Arnold promotes the 'web-of-life' metaphor as a more appropriate representation of evolutionary change in all lifeforms. This research level text is suitable for senior undergraduate and graduate level students taking related courses in departments of genetics, ecology and evolution. It will also be of relevance and use to professional evolutionary biologists and systematists seeking a comprehensive and authoritative overview of this rapidly expanding field.},

We investigated the photophysiological response of two genetically distinct Symbiodinium subtypes within clade A upon exposure to elevated temperatures at two light intensities for 3 weeks. While both subtypes displayed a characteristic photoacclimation to high light (HL) (decrease in light-harvesting pigments, lower photochemical efficiency of photosystem II, increased xanthophyll pool sizes), the tolerance toward thermal stress clearly differed between the two subtypes. Symbiodinium Ax was highly susceptible to chronic photoinhibition at temperatures ≥30°C, which was exacerbated under HL conditions. A1 showed a capacity for photoacclimation and high thermal tolerance, which might be related to higher cellular concentrations of photoprotective xanthophylls and the low-molecular antioxidant glutathione (GSx) along with the dynamic regulation of these photoprotective pathways. Whereas HL conditions induced both accumulation of diatoxanthin and GSx, thermal stress further stimulated xanthophyll cycling, which might compensate for diminished amounts of GSx at elevated temperatures. Our results show that the two clade A subtypes clearly differ in their strategies to cope with thermal stress in combination with high irradiance.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Events occurring early in life history can have profound effects on the structure of populations and communities. In particular, susceptibility to predation is often highest early in life, and can greatly influence community structure. To better understand these events in reef-forming coral communities, we investigated how spatial variation in recruitment and early post-settlement predation influenced the spatial structure of a coral assemblage. Over a 5 yr period, we compared recruitment of corals and abundance of juveniles and adults at a combination of 3 locations and 3 depths in French Polynesia. We then measured mortality of recruits mo old) and juveniles (about 1 to 4 yr old), and abundance of potential predators. Results demonstrate the crucial role of events occurring in the first weeks of the benthic stage. The abundance of scraping herbivorous parrotfishes explained substantial spatial variation in the mortality of recruits, but not juveniles, revealing a likely effect of incidental removal by grazing. Conversely, abundance of coral-feeding butterflyfishes explained substantial spatial variation in the mortality of juveniles. These findings underscore the importance of incidental mortality from grazing and specialized corallivory on coral populations. Moreover, these processes can play a key role in determining spatial patterns in coral assemblage structure.},

The strains could be separated into three groups after constructing a dendro- gram by the unweighted average linkage clustering method based on calculations of similarity coefficients. Soluble protein patterns obtained from the algae were also strain- specific. A dendrogram constructed from data obtained by analysis of protein patterns resolved by a polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis was similar to the dendrogram constructed from the data on isoenzyme patterns, but suggested that the 'phenetic' distances between strains were larger than indicated by the isoenzyme patterns.

abstract = {Reef-building corals are fundamental to the most diverse marine ecosystems, yet a detailed understanding of the processes involved in the establishment, persistence and ecology of the coral-dinoflagellate association remains largely unknown. This study explores symbiont diversity in relation to habitat by employing a broad-scale sampling regime using ITS2 and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Samples from Pocillopora damicornis, Stylophora pistillata and Seriatopora hystrix all harboured host-specific clade C symbiont types at Heron Island (Great Barrier Reef, Australia). While Ser. hystrix associated with a single symbiont profile along its entire depth distribution, both P. damicornis and Sty. pistillata associated with multiple symbiont profiles that showed a strong zonation with depth. It is shown that, with an increased sampling effort, previously identified 'rare' symbiont types within this group of host species are in fact environmental specialists. A multivariate approach was used to expand on the common distinction of symbionts by a single genetic identity. It shows merit in its capacity not only to include all the variability present within the marker region but also to reliably represent ecological diversification of symbionts. Furthermore, the cohesive species concept is explored to explain how niche partitioning may drive diversification of closely related symbiont lineages. This study provides thus evidence that closely related symbionts are ecologically distinct and fulfil their own niche within the ecosystem provided by the host and external environment.},

abstract = {Reef corals occur across a wide range of habitats, from offshore clear waters to nearshore sediment-laden environments. This study tests the hypothesis that corals from turbid nearshore areas have greater capacity to utilise suspended sediment as a food source than conspecifics from less turbid and midshelf areas. The hypothesis was tested on two common and widespread coral species on the Great Barrier Reef (Pocillopora damicornis and Acropora millepora). The particle clearance rates of samples from more turbid reefs were two-fourfold those of conspecifics from less turbid and midshelf reefs. Rates of sediment ingestion were generally a linear function of sediment load indicating no significant saturation within the concentration range of 1–30 mg dry weight l−1. Estimated assimilation efficiency of particulate 14C varied between 50 and 80{\%}, and was maximised for midshelf A. millepora at the lowest sediment concentration, suggesting that heterotrophy is more efficient in oligotrophic habitats. Based on feeding-response curves, assimilation efficiencies, and published records of ambient particle concentrations, representatives of these species on turbid inshore reefs are 10–20 times more heterotrophic on suspended sediment than their conspecifics on less turbid and midshelf reefs.},

abstract = {The nucleotide sequence analysis of the PCR products corresponding to the variable large- subunit rRNA domains D1, D2, D9, and D10 from ten representative dinoflagellate species is reported. Species were selected among the main laboratory-grown di- noflagellate groups: Prorocentrales, Gymnodiniales, and Peridiniales which comprise a variety of morphological and ecological characteristics. The sequence alignments comprising up to 1,000 nucleotides from all ten species were employed to analyze the phylogenetic relationships among these dinoflagellates. Maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining trees were inferred from the data gen- erated and subsequently tested by bootstrapping. Both the D1/D2 and the D9/D10 regions led to coherent trees in which the main class of dinoflagellates, Dinophyceae, is divided in three groups: prorocentroid, gymnodinioid, and peridinioid. An interesting outcome from the molec- ular phylogeny obtained was the uncertain emergence of Prorocentrum lima. The molecular results reported agreed with morphological classifications within Peridi- niales but not with those of Prorocentrales and Gymno- diniales. Additionally, the sequence comparison analysis provided strong evidence to suggest that Alexandrium minutum and Alexandrium lusitanicum were synony- mous species given the identical sequence they shared. Moreover, clone GglV, which was determined Gymno- dinium catenatum based on morphological criteriawould correspond to a new species of the genus Gym- nodinium as its sequence clearly differed from that ob-tained in G. catenatum. The sequence of the amplified fragments was demonstrated to be a valuable tool for phylogenetic and taxonomical analysis among these highly diversified species},

However, the ploidy of a number of dinoflagellates remains unknown, and molecular genetic support for haploidy in this group has been lacking. To elucidate the ploidy of symbiotic dinoflagellates belonging to the genus Symbiodinium, we used five polymorphic microsatellites to examine populations harbored by the Caribbean gorgonians Plexaura kuna and Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae; we also studied a series of Symbiodinium cultures. In 690 out of 728 Symbiodinium samples in hospite (95{\%} of the cases) and in all 45 Symbiodinium cultures, only a single allele was recovered per locus. Statistical testing of the Symbiodinium populations harbored by P. elisabethae revealed that the observed genotype frequencies deviate significantly from those expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Taken together, our results confirm that, in the vegetative life stage, members of Symbiodinium, both cultured and in hospite, are haploid. Furthermore, based on the phylogenetics of the dinoflagellates, haploidy in vegetative cells appears to be an ancestral trait that extends to all 2,000 extant species of these important unicellular protists.},

abstract = {Here, we introduce ezRAD, a novel strategy for restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) that requires little technical expertise or investment in laboratory equipment, and demonstrate its utility for ten non-model organisms across a wide taxonomic range. ezRAD differs from other RAD methods primarily through its use of standard Illumina TruSeq library preparation kits, which makes it possible for any laboratory to send out to a commercial genomic core facility for library preparation and next-generation sequencing with virtually no additional investment beyond the cost of the service itself. This simplification opens RADseq to any lab with the ability to extract DNA and perform a restriction digest. ezRAD also differs from others in its flexibility to use any restriction enzyme (or combination of enzymes) that cuts frequently enough to generate fragments of the desired size range, without requiring the purchase of separate adapters for each enzyme or a sonication step, which can further decrease the cost involved in choosing optimal enzymes for particular species and research questions. We apply this method across a wide taxonomic diversity of non-model organisms to demonstrate the utility and flexibility of our approach. The simplicity of ezRAD makes it particularly useful for the discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms and targeted amplicon sequencing in natural populations of non-model organisms that have been historically understudied because of lack of genomic information.},

abstract = {The Smith-Waterman algorithm yields a single alignment, which, albeit optimal, can be strongly affected by the choice of the scoring matrix and the gap penalties. Additionally, the scores obtained are dependent upon the lengths of the aligned sequences, requiring a post-analysis conversion. To overcome some of these shortcomings, we developed a Bayesian algorithm for local sequence alignment (BALSA), that takes into account the uncertainty associated with all unknown variables by incorporating in its forward sums a series of scoring matrices, gap parameters and all possible alignments. The algorithm can return both the joint and the marginal optimal alignments, samples of alignments drawn from the posterior distribution and the posterior probabilities of gap penalties and scoring matrices. Furthermore, it automatically adjusts for variations in sequence lengths. BALSA was compared with SSEARCH, to date the best performing dynamic programming algorithm in the detection of structural neighbors. Using the SCOP databases PDB40D-B and PDB90D-B, BALSA detected 19.8 and 41.3{\%} of remote homologs whereas SSEARCH detected 18.4 and 38{\%} at an error rate of 1{\%} errors per query over the databases, respectively.},

Infection by these hybrid symbionts may result in different host-plant phenotypes from those caused as a result of infection by nonhybrid symbionts. Observations of wild Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) populations show that hybrid Neotyphodium-infected (H+) grasses dominate in resource-poor environments, whereas nonhybrid endophyte-infected (NH+) grasses dominate in environments with more resources. We studied the hypothesis that hybridization of endophytes increases stress tolerance of the host. • To test whether hybridization of Neotyphodium affects performance and competitive abilities of the host depending on resources, we conducted a glasshouse experiment where competition, nutrients and watering were manipulated. • H+ plants had greater wet biomass than NH+ and endophyte-free plants, when grown in competition, but only in low-water and low-nutrient treatments. By contrast, NH+ plants did not perform better than H+ or endophyte-free plants regardless of the treatment combination. • Our results suggest that hybridization of symbiotic Neotyphodium endophytes may increase competitive potential of the host in stressful environments and that this hybridization may be underlying niche expansion of Arizona fescue in the environments with low resources.},

To carry out these goals, DNA sequence data from nuclear (ITS and 28S) and mitochondrial (16S and COI) markers were analyzed for several coral species and for Mediterranean populations of D. dianthus. Three phylogenetic methodologies (ML, MP and BI), based on data from the four molecular markers, all supported D. dianthus as clearly belonging to the "robust" clade, in which the species Lophelia pertusa and D. dianthus not only grouped together, but also shared haplotypes for some DNA markers. Molecular results also showed shared haplotypes among D. dianthus populations distributed in regions separated by several thousands of kilometers and by clear geographic barriers. These results could reflect limited molecular and morphological taxonomic resolution rather than real widespread connectivity. Additional studies are needed in order to find molecular markers and morphological features able to disentangle the complex phylogenetic relationship in the Order Scleractinia and to differentiate isolated populations, thus avoiding the homoplasy found in some morphological characters that are still considered in the literature.},

abstract = {In 2007 and 2008, multiple sites were identified in the Wakatobi Marine National Park, South East Sulawesi, Indonesia, which each represented a point along a gradient of light quality, temperature and turbidity. This gradient included 'optimal', intermediate and marginal sites, where conditions were close to the survival threshold limit for corals. Coral communities changed across this gradient from diverse, mixed growth form assemblages to specialised, massive growth form dominated communities. The massive coral Goniastrea aspera was the only species identified at the most marginal and optimal sites. Branching species Acropora formosa and Porites cylindrica were only identified at optimal sites. The in hospite Symbiodinium community also changed across the environmental gradient from members of the Symbiodinium clade C on optimal reefs (in branching and massive species) to clade D on marginal reefs (in massive species). Substantial variability in respiration and photosynthesis was observed in massive coral species under different environmental conditions, which suggests that all corals cannot be considered equal across environments. Studying present-day marginal environments is crucial to further understanding of future reef bio-diversity, functioning and accretion, and from work presented here, it is likely that as future climate change extends marginal reef range, branching coral diversity may decrease relative to massive, more resilient corals. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The genetic enhancement of wild animals and plants for characteristics that benefit human populations has been practiced for thousands of years, resulting in impressive improvements in commercially valuable species. Despite these benefits, genetic manipulations are rarely considered for noncommercial purposes, such as conservation and restoration initiatives. Over the last century, humans have driven global climate change through industrialization and the release of increasing amounts of CO2, resulting in shifts in ocean temperature, ocean chemistry, and sea level, as well as increasing frequency of storms, all of which can profoundly impact marine ecosystems. Coral reefs are highly diverse ecosystems that have suffered massive declines in health and abundance as a result of these and other direct anthropogenic disturbances. There is great concern that the high rates, magnitudes, and complexity of environmental change are overwhelming the intrinsic capacity of corals to adapt and survive. Although it is important to address the root causes of changing climate, it is also prudent to explore the potential to augment the capacity of reef organisms to tolerate stress and to facilitate recovery after disturbances. Here, we review the risks and benefits of the improvement of natural and commercial stocks in noncoral reef systems and advocate a series of experiments to determine the feasibility of developing coral stocks with enhanced stress tolerance through the acceleration of naturally occurring processes, an approach known as (human)-assisted evolution, while at the same time initiating a public dialogue on the risks and benefits of this approach.},

Through the process of photoadaptation, corals and their algal symbionts adjust algal densities and pigment concentrations to function over a wide range of light levels ranging from direct exposure to full sunlight in intertidal corals to virtual darkness at the extreme limits of the photic zone ({\textgreater}200 m) on reef slopes (Zahl and McLaughlin 1959; Schlichter et al. 1986). Corals and reef communities in some areas (such as the Arabian Gulf) tolerate salinity and temperature conditions that are lethal when imposed rapidly on the same species in less extreme environments (Coles 1988; Sheppard 1988; Coles and Fadlallah 1991; Chap. 23, Jokiel, this Vol.). There are abundant reports of reef corals occurring in turbid, high nutrient, nearshore habitats (Larcombe et al. 2001). Coral reefs exist at the inherently variable interface between the sea, air and land (Smith and Buddemeier 1992), and reef communities have persisted over geological time through significant climate and sea-level fluctuations. Despite this, rates of speciation and extinction in scleractinian corals have been relatively low over the last 220 million years (Veron 1995). Because the mechanisms by which reef corals adjust to these diverse environments are only poorly understood, we have little basis for estimating or predicting actual or potential rates of adaptive change. This issue is of particular interest because of the present high rates of coral mortality and reef degradation (e.g., Hoegh-Guldberg 1999; Wilkinson 2000) caused in substantial measure by the two large-scale threats of bleaching and other diseases.},

abstract = {Members of many invertebrate groups live symbiotically with unicellular algae, but the symbiosis between corals amid dinoflagellate algae (zooxanthelhae) is espe cially interesting because it occurs in all species of tropical reef-buildimig corals ( see reviews by Droop, 1963 ; Yonge, 1963 ; McLaughlin and Zahl, 1966) . Moreover, a significant effect of the algae om-m time physiology of corals has been clearly demon strated and quantified : Corals with symbiotic algae calcify n-many timies faster iii light than in darkness, while corals which have lost their zooxanthelhae calcify at rates which are slower and unaffected by light (Kawaguti and Sakumoto, 1948; Goreau, 1959 ; Goreau and Goreau, 1959) . In the light, photosynthesis by zoo xanthellae must soniehow lead to higher rates of calcification by corals. Three mechanism-mis have been proposed to explain how zooxamithehlae imifluemice coral calcification : ( 1) removal of carbon dioxide in photosymithiesis directly favors chemical equilibria leading to the precipitation of calcium-mi carbonate (Goreau, 1959) ; (2) algal removal of phosphates, which n-mayact as crystal poisomis, enhances crystallization of calcium carbonate (Simkiss, 1964a, 1964b) ; and (3) orgamiic products of photosynthesis, either specific mi-materials required for skeletogenesis, or nutrients or general energy sources supplied to the coral, ierm-m-mit faster calcifica tion (Goreau, 1959 ; Wainwright, 1963) . So far, there has been i-moexperimental evidence which conclusively supports or eliminates one hypothesis or another. One observation appears to be inconsistent with current ideas about the inti nate relationship between algal photosynthesis and coral calcification. In tFmestag horn coral, Acropora cervicornis ( Fig. 1) , as in other bramiching forms, calcification rates are highest in the tips, decreasing progressively towards the base (Goreau and Goreau, 1959) . However, very few symbiotic algae are found iii the tips, their numbers increasing towards the base. Where abumidanit, they give the coral a deep brown color, contrasting sharply' with the whiteness of the almost algae-free tips (Figs. 1 and 2). We undertook a study of ti-merapidly calcifying tips in order to clarify the problem of how the algae stimulate coral calcification rates.},

abstract = {Over the last few decades, sessile benthic organisms from the Mediterranean Sea have suffered from the global warming of the world's oceans, and several mass mortality events were observed during warm summers. It has been hypothesized that mortality could have been due to a nutrient (food) shortage following the stratification of the water column. However, the symbiotic gorgonian Eunicella singularis has also presented a locally exceptional mortality, despite its autotrophic capacities through the photosynthesis of its dinoflagellate symbionts. Thus, this study has experimentally investigated the response of E. singularis to a thermal stress (temperature increase from 18 to 26 degrees C), with colonies maintained more than 2 months under four nutritional diets: autotrophy only (AO), autotrophy and inorganic nitrogen addition (AN), autotrophy and heterotrophy (AH), heterotrophy only (HO). At 18 degrees C, and contrary to many other anthozoans, supplementation of autotrophy with either inorganic nitrogen or food (heterotrophy) had no effect on the rates of respiration, photosynthesis, as well as in the chlorophyll, lipid and protein content. In the dark, heterotrophy maintained the gorgonian's metabolism, except a bleaching (loss of pigments), which did not affect the rates of photosynthesis. At 24 degrees C, rates of respiration, and photosynthesis significantly decreased in all treatments. At 26 degrees C, in addition to a decrease in the lipid content of all treatments, a bleaching was observed after 1 week in the AO treatment, while the AH and AN treatments resisted three weeks before bleaching. These last results suggest that, temperatures above 24 degrees C impair the energetic reserves of this species and might explain the mortality events in the Mediterranean.},

abstract = {The symbiosis between cnidarians (e.g., corals or sea anemones) and intracellular dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium is of immense ecological importance. In particular, this symbiosis promotes the growth and survival of reef corals in nutrient-poor tropical waters; indeed, coral reefs could not exist without this symbiosis. However, our fundamental understanding of the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis and of its links to coral calcification remains poor. Here we review what we currently know about the cell biology of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis. In doing so, we aim to refocus attention on fundamental cellular aspects that have been somewhat neglected since the early to mid-1980s, when a more ecological approach began to dominate. We review the four major processes that we believe underlie the various phases of establishment and persistence in the cnidarian/coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis: (i) recognition and phagocytosis, (ii) regulation of host-symbiont biomass, (iii) metabolic exchange and nutrient trafficking, and (iv) calcification. Where appropriate, we draw upon examples from a range of cnidarian-alga symbioses, including the symbiosis between green Hydra and its intracellular chlorophyte symbiont, which has considerable potential to inform our understanding of the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis. Ultimately, we provide a comprehensive overview of the history of the field, its current status, and where it should be going in the future.},

Coral colonies harboring clade C are often the most exposed to physical stressors. The genotypic diversity, dispersal and genetic connectivity exhibited by these Symbiodinium are the subjects of an increasing number of population genetic studies utilizing microsatellites. Here we describe 18 new microsatellite loci and test their utility across four common clade C types. We obtained multi-locus genotypes with individual level resolution in each of these types. Our results indicate that multi-locus genotypes can be obtained for many members of clade C using a subset of these markers. Data from these markers may assess population dynamics during coral bleaching and recovery as well as resolve boundaries to genetic recombination among these closely related, yet ecologically distinct, lineages.},

In some of the surveyed sites, these corals accounted for 80–90 {\%} of the living cover, making it a biotope-dominant organism. Unlike Siderastrea corals from West Atlantic and Caribbean loca- tions, genetic analyses of the dinoflagellate symbiotic partner revealed high specificity between Siderastrea sp. in Cape Verde and the Symbiodinium type C46. Biotope restriction of the ecological success of Siderastrea in Cape Verde may be explained in part by this host–symbiont partnership, resulting resulting locally in a small optimum ecological niche with specific light intensity regimes. Distinctively, West Atlantic and Caribbean Siderastrea associates with a much broader range of Symbiodinium diversity, suggesting that these sym- bioses exhibit some flexibility under differing environmental conditions where these corals occupy a wider range of eco- logical niches. Geographic isolation and/or long-standing environmental conditions are probably responsible for such adaptions and coral–dinoflagellate symbioses. Additional ge- netic analyses on Clade C Symbiodinium associated with Siderastrea were conducted with the hyper-variable plastid psbA minicircle to resolve phylogeographic patterns that in- dicate the relative connectivity and/or isolation of these sym- bionts throughout the tropical Atlantic.},

abstract = {Until around 1990, most multigene families were thought to be subject to concerted evolution, in which all member genes of a family evolve as a unit in concert. However, phylogenetic analysis of MHC and other immune system genes showed a quite different evolutionary pattern, and a new model called birth-and-death evolution was proposed. In this model, new genes are created by gene duplication and some duplicate genes stay in the genome for a long time, whereas others are inactivated or deleted from the genome. Later investigations have shown that most non-rRNA genes including highly conserved histone or ubiquitin genes are subject to this type of evolution. However, the controversy over the two models is still continuing because the distinction between the two models becomes difficult when sequence differences are small. Unlike concerted evolution, the model of birth-and-death evolution can give some insights into the origins of new genetic systems or new phenotypic characters. Keywords},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Internal transcribed spacer of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) is already one of the most popular phylogenetic and DNA barcoding markers. However, the existence of its multiple copies has complicated such usage and a detailed characterization of intra-genomic variations is critical to address such concerns. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we used sequence-tagged pyrosequencing and genome-wide analyses to characterize intra-genomic variations of internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) regions from 178 plant species. We discovered that mutation of ITS2 is frequent, with a mean of 35 variants per species. And on average, three of the most abundant variants make up 91{\%} of all ITS2 copies. Moreover, we found different congeneric species share identical variants in 13 genera. Interestingly, different species across different genera also share identical variants. In particular, one minor variant of ITS2 in Eleutherococcus giraldii was found identical to the ITS2 major variant of Panax ginseng, both from Araliaceae family. In addition, DNA barcoding gap analysis showed that the intra-genomic distances were markedly smaller than those of the intra-specific or inter-specific variants. When each of 5543 variants were examined for its species discrimination efficiency, a 97{\%} success rate was obtained at the species level. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of identical ITS2 variants across intra-generic or inter-generic species revealed complex species evolutionary history, possibly, horizontal gene transfer and ancestral hybridization. Although intra-genomic multiple variants are frequently found within each genome, the usage of the major variants alone is sufficient for phylogeny construction and species determination in most cases. Furthermore, the inclusion of minor variants further improves the resolution of species identification.},

abstract = {Dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium in symbiosis with marine animals release much of their photosynthetic carbon to the animal host. The compounds translocated to the host (‘mobile compounds') were investigated by metabolite comparison as follows: a substrate was identified as a candidate mobile compound when comparable profiles of metabolites were generated from host metabolism of this substrate (supplied exogenously) and the endogenous mobile compounds. When the sea anemone Anemonia viridis was incubated with NaH14CO2 under photosynthesizing conditions, most of the radioactivity in the animal tissue was recovered from the low-molecular-mass fraction and distributed in the ratio 1:2:1 between the neutral, acidic and basic sub- fractions. Prominent 14C-labelled compounds included glucose, malate and glucose-6-phosphate. When thesymbiosis was incubated with 14C-labelled glucose plus succinate or fumarate (but none of eight other substrate combinations tested), the 14C-labelled metabolites closely matched those obtained with NaH14CO2. These data suggest that glucose and succinate/fumarate (or metabolically allied compounds) may be important photosynthetic compounds transferred from the Symbiodinium cells to the tissues of A. viridis. Metabolite comparisons can be applied to study nutritional interactions in symbioses involving photosynthetic algae and, with appropriate modification, other associations between microorganisms and plants or animals.

Despite the large number of species described exclusively using light microscopic morphology, the assessment of species diversity is hampered by extensive morphological plasticity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Two independent types of molecular data, the chloroplast-encoded psbA/rbcL spacer complemented by rbcL gene and the internal transcribed spacer 2 of the nuclear rDNA cistron (ITS2), congruently recovered a robust phylogenetic structure. With ITS2 considerable sequence and secondary structure divergence existed among the eight species, but a combined sequence and secondary structure phylogenetic analysis confined to helix II of ITS2 corroborated relationships as inferred from the rbcL gene phylogeny. Intra-genomic divergence of ITS2 sequences was revealed in many strains. The 'monophyletic species concept', appropriate for microalgae without known sexual reproduction, revealed eight different species. Species boundaries established using the molecular-based monophyletic species concept were more conservative than the traditional morphological species concept. Within a species, almost identical chloroplast marker sequences (genotypes) were repeatedly recovered from strains of different origins. At least two species had widespread geographical distributions; however, within a given species, genotypes recovered from Antarctic strains were distinct from those in temperate habitats. Furthermore, the sequence diversity may correspond to adaptation to different types of habitats or climates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We established a method and a reference data base for the unambiguous identification of species of the common soil microalgal genus Heterococcus which uses DNA sequence variation in markers from plastid and nuclear genomes. The molecular data were more reliable and more conservative than morphological data.},

Emerging evidence for variability in the coral calcification response to acidification, geographical variation in bleaching susceptibility and recovery, responses to past climate change, and potential rates of adaptation to rapid warming supports an alternative scenario in which reef degradation occurs with greater temporal and spatial heterogeneity than current projections suggest. Reducing uncertainty in projecting coral reef futures requires improved understanding of past responses to rapid climate change; physiological responses to interacting factors, such as temperature, acidification, and nutrients; and the costs and constraints imposed by acclimation and adaptation.},

For dinoflagellates, an ancient alveolate group of about 2000 described extant species, DNA barcoding studies have revealed large amounts of unrecognized species diversity, most of which is not represented in culture collections. To date, two mitochondrial gene markers, Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) and Cytochrome b oxidase (COB), have been used to assess DNA barcoding in dinoflagellates, and both failed to amplify all taxa and suffered from low resolution. Nevertheless, both genes yielded many examples of morphospecies showing cryptic speciation and morphologically distinct named species being genetically similar, highlighting the need for a common marker. For example, a large number of cultured Symbiodinium strains have neither taxonomic identification, nor a common measure of diversity that can be used to compare this genus to other dinoflagellates.},

To enable population genetic analyses of Symbiodinium spp, required for coral reef conservation, seven microsatellite loci were isolated from Symbiodinium clade C from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. These microsatellite primer pairs consistently amplified between 1 and 8 alleles per coral host colony, with mean number of alleles ranging from 1.9 to 4.0 and generally high genetic diversities (Shannon's Index = 0.71-2.76). The novel microsatellite loci amplified between 1 and 10 alleles in four other C strains, but did not amplify a D strain. Three of six previously published clade C microsatellite loci amplified 1-6 alleles in two or more of five C strains tested.

abstract = {The abundance and distribution of free-living dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium have important implications for the ecology of coral reefs, determining both the symbionts available to newly recruited corals and symbiont types available for uptake by adult corals during environmental stress. However, little is known about where symbiotic dinoflagellates reside outside the host, due to the difficulty of capturing and detecting unicellular organisms in the marine environment. This study presents a successful protocol for sampling Symbiodinium from both the benthos and the water column. Comparisons of two detection methods for enumerating Symbiodinium indicated that conventional microscope analysis is accurate and more efficient when estimating Symbiodinium densities in sediment samples, while an automated particle counter (FlowCAM) was more efficient in detecting cells in the water column where densities are low. Symbiodinium densities were found to be relatively high (1000-4000??cells/mL) in sediment samples and much lower (up to 80??cells/mL) in the water column, indicating that the free-living form resides mainly in the benthos. Symbiodinium densities were found to be highly variable spatially, differing significantly between two reef locations. Within sites, elevated densities of Symbiodinium along reef margins combined with significant decreases in densities one meter away from the reef, suggest that cells aggregate within the reef habitat. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Coral bleaching has been identified as one of the major contributors to coral reef decline, and the occurrence of different symbionts determined by broad genetic groupings (clades A-H) is commonly used to explain thermal responses of reef-building corals. By using Stylophora pistillata as a model, we monitored individual tagged colonies in situ over a two-year period and show that fine level genetic variability within clade C is correlated to differences in bleaching susceptibility. Based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the internal transcribed spacer region 2, visual bleaching assessments, symbiont densities, host protein, and pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry, we show that subcladal types C78 and C8/a are more thermally tolerant than C79 and C35/a, which suffered significant bleaching and postbleaching mortality. Although additional symbiont types were detected during bleaching in colonies harboring types C79 and C35/a, all colonies reverted back to their original symbionts postbleaching. Most importantly, the data propose that the differential mortality of hosts harboring thermally sensitive versus resistant symbionts rather than symbiont shuffling/switching within a single host is responsible for the observed symbiont composition changes of coral communities after bleaching. This study therefore highlights that the use of broad cladal designations may not be suitable to describe differences in bleaching susceptibility, and that differential mortality results in a loss of both symbiont and host genetic diversity and therefore represents an important mechanism in explaining how coral reef communities may respond to changing conditions.},

abstract = {Although the effect of biodiversity on ecosys- tem functioning has become a major focus in ecology, its significance in a fluctuating environment is still poorly un- derstood. According to the insurance hypothesis, biodiversity insures ecosystems against declines in their functioning be- cause many species provide greater guarantees that some will maintain functioning even if others fail. Here we examine this hypothesis theoretically. We develop a general stochastic dynamic model to assess the effects of species richness on the expected temporal mean and variance of ecosystem processes such as productivity, based on individual species' productivity responses to environmental fluctuations. Our model shows two major insurance effects of species richness on ecosystem productivity: (i) a buffering effect, i.e., a reduction in the temporal variance of productivity, and (ii) a performance- enhancing effect, i.e., an increase in the temporal mean of productivity. The strength of these insurance effects is deter- mined by three factors: (i) the way ecosystem productivity is determined by individual species responses to environmental fluctuations, (ii) the degree of asynchronicity of these re- sponses, and (iii) the detailed form of these responses. In particular, the greater the variance of the species responses, the lower the species richness at which the temporal mean of the ecosystem process saturates and the ecosystem becomes redundant. These results provide a strong theoretical foun- dation for the insurance hypothesis, which proves to be a fundamental principle for understanding the long-term ef- fects of biodiversity on ecosystem processes},

Species of the genus Symbiodinium form symbiotic relationships with reef-building corals and other marine invertebrates. Despite their ecologic importance, little is known about the genetics of dinoflagellates in general and Symbiodinium in particular. Here, we used 454 sequencing to generate transcriptome data from two Symbiodinium species from different clades (clade A and clade B). With more than 56,000 assembled sequences per species, these data represent the largest transcriptomic resource for dinoflagellates to date. Our results corroborate previous observations that dinoflagellates possess the complete nucleosome machinery. We found a complete set of core histones as well as several H3 variants and H2A.Z in one species. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis points toward a low number of transcription factors in Symbiodinium spp. that also differ in the distribution of DNA-binding domains relative to other eukaryotes. In particular the cold shock domain was predominant among transcription factors. Additionally, we found a high number of antioxidative genes in comparison to non-symbiotic but evolutionary related organisms. These findings might be of relevance in the context of the role that Symbiodinium spp. play as coral symbionts.Our data represent the most comprehensive dinoflagellate EST data set to date. This study provides a comprehensive resource to further analyze the genetic makeup, metabolic capacities, and gene repertoire of Symbiodinium and dinoflagellates. Overall, our findings indicate that Symbiodinium possesses some unique characteristics, in particular the transcriptional regulation in Symbiodinium may differ from the currently known mechanisms of eukaryotic gene regulation.},

abstract = {The capacity of reef-building corals to associate with environmentally-appropriate types of endosymbionts from the dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium contributes significantly to their success at local scales. Additionally, some corals are able to acclimatize to environmental perturbations by shuffling the relative proportions of different Symbiodinium types hosted. Understanding the dynamics of these symbioses requires a sensitive and quantitative method of Symbiodinium genotyping. Electrophoresis methods, still widely utilized for this purpose, are predominantly qualitative and cannot guarantee detection of a background type below 10{\%} of the total Symbiodinium population. Here, the relative abundances of four Symbiodinium types (A13, C1, C3, and D1) in mixed samples of known composition were quantified using deep sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer of the ribosomal RNA gene (ITS-2) by means of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) using Roche 454. In samples dominated by each of the four Symbiodinium types tested, background levels of the other three types were detected when present at 5{\%}, 1{\%}, and 0.1{\%} levels, and their relative abundances were quantified with high (A13, C1, D1) to variable (C3) accuracy. The potential of this deep sequencing method for resolving fine-scale genetic diversity within a symbiont type was further demonstrated in a natural symbiosis using ITS-1, and uncovered reef-specific differences in the composition of Symbiodinium microadriaticum in two species of acroporid corals (Acropora digitifera and A. hyacinthus) from Palau. The ability of deep sequencing of the ITS locus (1 and 2) to detect and quantify low-abundant Symbiodinium types, as well as finer-scale diversity below the type level, will enable more robust quantification of local genetic diversity in Symbiodinium populations. This method will help to elucidate the role that background types have in maximizing coral fitness across diverse environments and in response to environmental change.},

abstract = {The potential of corals to associate with more temperature-tolerant strains of algae (zooxanthellae, Symbiodinium) can have important implications for the future of coral reefs in an era of global climate change. In this study, the genetic identity and diversity of zooxanthellae was investigated at three reefs with contrasting histories of bleaching mortality, water temperature and shading, in the Republic of Palau (Micronesia). Single-stranded conformation polymorphism and sequence analysis of the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS)1 region was used for genotyping. A chronically warm but partly shaded coral reef in a marine lake that is hydrographically well connected to the surrounding waters harboured only two single-stranded conformation polymorphism profiles (i.e. zooxanthella communities). It consisted only of Symbiodinium D in all 13 nonporitid species and two Porites species investigated, with the remaining five Porites harbouring C•. Despite the high temperature in this lake ({\{}{\textgreater}{\}} 0.5° above ambient), this reef did not suffer coral mortality during the (1998) bleaching event, however, no bleaching-sensitive coral families and genera occur in the coral community. This setting contrasts strongly with two other reefs with generally lower temperatures, in which 10 and 12 zooxanthella communities with moderate to low proportions of clade D zooxanthellae were found. The data indicate that whole coral assemblages, when growing in elevated seawater temperatures and at reduced irradiance, can be composed of colonies associated with the more thermo-tolerant clade D zooxanthellae. Future increases in seawater temperature might, therefore, result in an increasing prevalence of Symbiodinium phylotype D in scleractinian corals, possibly associated with a loss of diversity in both zooxanthellae and corals.},

This study revealed that P. versipora associates with at least two distinct genotypes of symbiotic dinoflagellates and that the presence of these genotypes varies with latitude. P. versipora colonies from subtropical and tropical waters contained symbionts belonging to Symbiodinium clade C, while P. versipora colonies at high-latitude sites contained clade B. Variability within the two groups of symbionts (clades B and C) was minimal, suggesting possible host fidelity. The geographically distinct varieties of symbionts within the tissue of this hermatypic coral are likely to be associated with algal physiological differences, which in turn may relate to changing selective pressures as a function of latitude along the eastern Australian seaboard.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Efforts to monitor coral reefs rarely combine ecological and genetic tools to provide insight into the processes driving patterns of change. We focused on a coral reef at 14 m depth in St. John, US Virgin Islands, and used both sets of tools to examine 12 colonies of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Orbicella{\textless}/i{\textgreater} (formerly {\textless}i{\textgreater}Montastraea{\textless}/i{\textgreater}) {\textless}i{\textgreater}annularis{\textless}/i{\textgreater} in 2 photoquadrats that were monitored for 16 yr and sampled genetically at the start and end of the study. Coral cover and colony growth were assessed annually, microsatellites were used to genetically identify coral hosts in 2010, and their {\textless}i{\textgreater}Symbiodinium{\textless}/i{\textgreater} were genotyped using chloroplastic 23S (cloning) and nuclear ITS2 (cloning and pyrosequencing) in 1994 and 2010. Coral cover declined from 40 to 28{\%} between 1994 and 2010, and 3 of the 12 sampled colonies increased in size, while 9 decreased in size. The relative abundance of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Symbiodinium{\textless}/i{\textgreater} clades varied among corals over time, and patterns of change differed between photoquadrats but not among host genotypes. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Symbiodinium{\textless}/i{\textgreater} communities in 8 corals in 1 photoquadrat differed among colonies and changed over time, with a trend towards reduced abundance of clade C and increased abundance of clade B. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Symbiodinium{\textless}/i{\textgreater} communities in 4 corals in the second photoquadrat were similar among colonies, dominated by clade C, and remained relatively constant in clade composition over time. Based on an analysis that sampled only a small number of corals, but is unique in the long temporal scale and the combination of techniques employed, this study demonstrates that the processes underlying shifts in coral cover are complex and difficult to predict. Meter-scale variation in reef microhabitats affected {\textless}i{\textgreater}Symbiodinium{\textless}/i{\textgreater} communities in {\textless}i{\textgreater}O.{\&}{\#}xa0;annularis{\textless}/i{\textgreater}, and host genotype coupled with variation in {\textless}i{\textgreater}Symbiodinium{\textless}/i{\textgreater} communities appeared to mediate colony success. },

abstract = {Foraminifera are commonly defined as marine testate protists, and their diversity is mainly assessed on the basis of the morphology of their agglutinated or mineralized tests. Diversity surveys based on environmental DNA (eDNA) have dramatically changed this view by revealing an unexpected diversity of naked and organic-walled lineages as well as detecting foraminiferal lineages in soil and freshwater environments. Moreover, single-cell analyses have allowed discrimination among genetically distinctive types within almost every described morphospecies. In view of these studies, the foraminiferal diversity appeared to be largely underestimated, but its accurate estimation was impeded by the low speed and coverage of a cloning-based eDNA approach. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies, these limitations disappeared in favor of exhaustive descriptions of foraminiferal diversity in numerous samples. Yet, the biases and errors identified in early HTS studies raised some questions about the accuracy of HTS data and their biological interpretation. Among the most controversial issues affecting the reliability of HTS diversity estimates are (1) the impact of technical and biological biases, (2) the sensitivity and specificity of taxonomic sequence assignment, (3) the ability to distinguish rare species, and (4) the quantitative interpretation of HTS data. Here, we document the lessons learned from previous HTS surveys and present the current advances and applications focusing on foraminiferal eDNA. We discuss the problems associated with HTS approaches and predict the future trends and avenues that hold promises for surveying foraminiferal diversity accurately and efficiently.$\backslash$n},

In this study, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of 18S rRNA metabarcodes was used to investigate four sampling methods (modified syringe, sterilized sponge, underwater tape and sterilized swab) for characterizing eukaryotic communities in marine biofilms. Perspex(TM) plates were sampled in and out of water. DNA collected with tape did not amplify. Otherwise, there were no statistical differences in communities among the remaining three sampling devices or between the two environments. Sterilized sponges are recommended for ease of use underwater. In-depth HTS analysis identified diverse eukaryotic communities, dominated by Metazoa and Chromoalveolata. Among the latter, diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) were particularly abundant (33{\%} of reads assigned to Chromalveolata). The NIS Ciona savignyi was detected in all samples. The application of HTS in marine biofilm surveillance could facilitate early detection of NIS, improving the probability of successful eradication.},

abstract = {Metabarcode surveys of DNA extracted from environmental samples are increasingly popular for biodiversity assessment in natural communities. Such surveys rely heavily on robust genetic markers. Therefore, analysis of PCR efficiency and subsequent biodiversity estimation for different types of genetic markers and their corresponding primers is important. Here, we test the PCR efficiency and biodiversity recovery potential of three commonly used genetic markers - nuclear small subunit ribosomal DNA (18S), mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S ribosomal RNA (mt16S) - using 454 pyrosequencing of a zooplankton community collected from Hamilton Harbour, Ontario. We found that biodiversity detection power and PCR efficiency varied widely among these markers. All tested primers for COI failed to provide high-quality PCR products for pyrosequencing, but newly designed primers for 18S and 16S passed all tests. Furthermore, multiple analyses based on large-scale pyrosequencing (i.e. 1/2 PicoTiter plate for each marker) showed that primers for 18S recover more (38 orders) groups than 16S (10 orders) across all taxa, and four vs. two orders and nine vs. six families for Crustacea. Our results showed that 18S, using newly designed primers, is an efficient and powerful tool for profiling biodiversity in largely unexplored communities, especially when amplification difficulties exist for mitochondrial markers such as COI. Universal primers for higher resolution markers such as COI are still needed to address the possible low resolution of 18S for species-level identification.},

We used metabarcoding to compare benthic eukaryote composition from five estuaries of varying condition. In contrast to traditional studies, we found biotic richness was greatest in the most disturbed estuary, with this being due to the large volume of extraneous material (i.e. run-off from aquaculture, agriculture and other catchment activities) being deposited in the system. In addition, we found strong correlations between composition and a number of environmental variables, including nutrients, pH and turbidity. A wide range of taxa responded to these environmental gradients, providing new insights into their sensitivities to natural and anthropogenic stressors. Metabarcoding has the capacity to bolster current monitoring techniques, enabling the decisions regarding ecological condition to be based on a more holistic view of biodiversity.},

abstract = {Symbiotic partnerships between heterotrophic hosts and intracellular microalgae are common in tropical and subtropical oligotrophic waters of benthic and pelagic marine habitats. The iconic
example is the photosynthetic dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium that establishes mutualistic symbioses with a wide diversity of benthic hosts, sustaining highly biodiverse reef ecosystems worldwide. Paradoxically, although various species of photosynthetic dinoflagellates are prevalent
eukaryotic symbionts in pelagic waters, Symbiodinium has not yet been reported in symbiosis within oceanic plankton, despite its high propensity for the symbiotic lifestyle. Here we report a new pelagic photosymbiosis between a calcifying ciliate host and the microalga Symbiodinium in surface ocean waters. Confocal and scanning electron microscopy, together with an 18S rDNA-based phylogeny, showed that the host is a new ciliate species closely related to Tiarina fusus (Colepidae). Phylogenetic analyses of the endosymbionts based on the 28S rDNA gene revealed multiple novel closely related Symbiodinium clade A genotypes. A haplotype network using the high-resolution internal transcribed spacer-2 marker showed that these genotypes form eight divergent, biogeographically structured, subclade types that do not seem to associate with any benthic hosts. Ecological analyses using the Tara Oceans metabarcoding data set (V9 region of the 18S rDNA) and contextual oceanographic parameters showed a global distribution of the symbiotic partnership in
nutrient-poor surface waters. The discovery of the symbiotic life of Symbiodinium in the open ocean provides new insights into the ecology and evolution of this pivotal microalga and raises new hypotheses about coastal pelagic connectivity.},
